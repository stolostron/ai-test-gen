# Evidence-Based Testing Framework with Progressive Context Intelligence

> **AI-Powered Testing Framework Using Main Framework's Own Principles for Maximum Reliability**

## 🎯 Framework Purpose

Provide comprehensive, intelligent testing for the claude-test-generator framework using evidence-based validation and progressive context awareness. Tests the main framework using its own sophisticated principles to ensure quality, prevent regressions, and enable continuous improvement.

**Framework Philosophy**: Test the framework as intelligently as the framework tests software.

## 🏗️ Testing Architecture: Evidence-Based Progressive Intelligence

### 📊 **Stage 1: Framework Analysis**
**"Understand what changed and why it matters"**
- **Mirror Agent A**: Analyzes CLAUDE.md and policy changes
- **Mirror Agent B**: Monitors template and format evolution
- **Mirror Agent C**: Tracks AI service and config modifications
- **Mirror Agent D**: Validates runtime behavior and outputs

### 🧠 **Stage 2: Intelligent Test Strategy**
**"Determine optimal testing approach based on changes"**
- **Change Impact Analysis**: AI determines testing requirements
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifies high-risk changes requiring deep testing
- **Test Optimization**: Balances coverage with efficiency
- **Progressive Learning**: Adapts strategy based on historical patterns

### 🔧 **Stage 3: Evidence-Based Validation**
**"Execute tests using main framework's own evidence standards"**
- **Implementation Validation**: Tests assumptions against reality
- **Pattern Verification**: Ensures outputs follow proven patterns
- **Quality Assessment**: Validates against progressive baselines
- **Learning Integration**: Improves testing through continuous learning

## 🚨 CRITICAL TESTING POLICY

### 🛡️ MANDATORY EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION
**Testing Requirements** (STRICTLY ENFORCED):
- 🔒 **Framework Integrity**: Never modify main framework files
