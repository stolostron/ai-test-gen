# Evidence-Based Testing Framework with Progressive Context Intelligence and Hierarchical Isolation

> **AI-Powered Testing Framework Using Main Framework's Own Principles for Maximum Reliability with Hierarchical Isolation Architecture and Comprehensive Safety Mechanisms**

## 🎯 Framework Purpose

Provide comprehensive, intelligent testing for the claude-test-generator framework using evidence-based validation and progressive context awareness with hierarchical isolation architecture. Tests the main framework using its own sophisticated principles to ensure quality, prevent regressions, and enable continuous improvement while maintaining strict app boundaries. Validates comprehensive safety mechanisms deployment and framework execution unification preventing split personality disorder.

**Framework Philosophy**: Test the framework as intelligently as the framework tests software, with complete isolation guarantee and comprehensive validation of framework execution integrity, agent output reality, and cascade failure prevention.

## 🏗️ Testing Architecture: Evidence-Based Progressive Intelligence

### 📊 **Stage 1: Framework Analysis**
**"Understand what changed and why it matters"**
- **Mirror Agent A**: Analyzes CLAUDE.md and policy changes
- **Mirror Agent B**: Monitors template and format evolution
- **Mirror Agent C**: Tracks AI service and config modifications
- **Mirror Agent D**: Validates runtime behavior and outputs

### 🧠 **Stage 2: Intelligent Test Strategy**
**"Determine optimal testing approach based on changes"**
- **Change Impact Analysis**: AI determines testing requirements
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifies high-risk changes requiring deep testing
- **Test Optimization**: Balances coverage with efficiency
- **Progressive Learning**: Adapts strategy based on historical patterns

### 🔧 **Stage 3: Evidence-Based Validation**
**"Execute tests using main framework's own evidence standards"**
- **Implementation Validation**: Tests assumptions against reality
- **Pattern Verification**: Ensures outputs follow proven patterns
- **Quality Assessment**: Validates against progressive baselines
- **Learning Integration**: Improves testing through continuous learning
