  - Health assessment: ✅ Core file accessibility confirmed
  - Version detection: ✅ Framework identity validated
  - Service architecture: ✅ Proper tgt-* naming convention
```

**Service Architecture Validation**:

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Complete Isolation Failure ❌ CRITICAL
**Issue**: Testing framework can modify main framework files
**Risk Level**: CRITICAL
**Impact**: Risk of corrupting main framework during testing
**Required Action**: Implement proper file system isolation immediately

### 2. Missing Write Protection ❌ HIGH
**Issue**: No mechanism prevents accidental modifications
**Risk Level**: HIGH  
**Impact**: Testing operations could damage production framework
**Required Action**: Add file system-level write protection

### 3. Security Boundary Violation ❌ HIGH
**Issue**: Testing framework should be read-only but has full write access
**Risk Level**: HIGH
**Impact**: Violates security principle of least privilege
**Required Action**: Enforce strict read-only access controls

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required (CRITICAL)
1. **Implement File System Isolation**
   - Add read-only file system mounting
   - Implement permission-based write blocking
   - Create isolated workspace for testing operations

2. **Add Safety Mechanisms**

## Conclusion

The testing framework demonstrates excellent connectivity and monitoring capabilities with the main claude-test-generator framework. However, **critical isolation failures** make it unsafe for production use. The framework can successfully:

- Read all main framework files and structure
- Monitor changes and track git activity  
- Inventory AI services and detect modifications
- Implement proper tgt-* service architecture

But it **FAILS** to enforce the most critical requirement: read-only access. This represents a significant security and safety risk that must be addressed before the testing framework can be considered production-ready.

**Immediate Priority**: Implement proper isolation enforcement to prevent any modifications to the main framework while preserving all monitoring and analysis capabilities.
