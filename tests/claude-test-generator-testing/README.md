# Claude Test Generator Testing Framework

> **Evidence-Based Testing Framework with Real-Time File Access and Progressive Intelligence**

## üéØ Purpose

This testing framework provides comprehensive, intelligent testing for the claude-test-generator framework using evidence-based validation and progressive context awareness. Features **current workspace file access** ensuring accurate testing regardless of git status, 21 AI services with 38.2% coverage of the main framework's 55 services, and real executable Python implementations for robust validation.

**Philosophy**: Test the framework as intelligently as the framework tests software, using current file state instead of git-tracked files only.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Basic Testing Commands

```bash
# Navigate to testing framework
cd /Users/ashafi/Documents/work/ai/ai_systems/tests/claude-test-generator-testing/

# Test recent framework changes
"Test framework changes"

# Run comprehensive validation
"Execute full framework validation"

# Check quality trends
"Analyze framework quality trends"

# Get testing recommendations
"Generate framework improvement recommendations"
```

### Direct Python Execution (Working Implementation)

```bash
# Real framework connectivity testing
python3 tgt-implementations/core/framework_connectivity_test.py

# Service discovery and intelligence gathering
python3 tgt-implementations/core/framework_intelligence_service.py

# Evidence collection with real data gathering
python3 tgt-implementations/evidence/real_evidence_collector.py

# Comprehensive functional test suite
python3 tgt-implementations/validation/functional_test_suite.py
```

### Testing After Framework Changes

1. Make changes to main framework:
   ```bash
   cd ../../apps/claude-test-generator/
   # Edit CLAUDE.md, configs, AI services, etc.
   ```

2. Test the changes:
   ```bash
   cd ../../tests/claude-test-generator-testing/
   "Test framework changes"
   ```

3. Review results and recommendations
4. Fix any issues identified
5. Retest to confirm fixes

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
