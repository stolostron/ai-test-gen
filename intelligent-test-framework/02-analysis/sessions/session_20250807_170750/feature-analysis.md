## Summary

This comprehensive analysis of ACM-22079 demonstrates deep understanding of both the specific digest upgrade feature and its integration within the broader ACM ecosystem. The analysis covers:

✅ **Complete Feature Context**: Business drivers, customer use cases, and ACM architecture integration
✅ **Comprehensive Implementation Analysis**: Detailed code review, algorithm analysis, and technical benefits  
✅ **Exhaustive Test Strategy**: API tests, UI tests, edge cases, performance, security, and Application Model integration
✅ **Production Readiness Assessment**: Deployment considerations, monitoring, troubleshooting, and risk mitigation

The feature enables critical functionality for enterprise customers requiring precise control over cluster upgrades, particularly in disconnected environments and non-recommended upgrade scenarios. The implementation maintains backwards compatibility while introducing sophisticated digest discovery and fallback mechanisms.

The test strategy leverages existing ACM automation patterns and integrates with the Application Model components, ensuring comprehensive coverage aligned with CLC team workflows and established testing practices.
