All four test cases have been generated covering the complete functionality of ACM-22079 digest-based upgrades. The test plan includes:

1. **Digest-Based Success Scenarios** - Core functionality with conditionalUpdates and availableUpdates fallback
2. **Tag-Based Fallback and Error Handling** - Fallback behavior and error conditions  
3. **Disconnected Environment and Multi-Cluster** - Air-gapped environments and concurrent operations
4. **RBAC and Security Validation** - Permission controls and security boundaries

Each test case provides complete CLI commands with expected outputs, UI navigation paths where applicable, and clear verification steps for both positive and negative scenarios.
