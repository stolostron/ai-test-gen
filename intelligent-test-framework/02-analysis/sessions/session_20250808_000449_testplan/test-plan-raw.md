## Cleanup and Verification

**Final Cleanup Steps:**
- Remove test namespaces: `oc delete namespace digest-upgrade-test`
- Clean up test ClusterCurators: `oc delete clustercurator -A -l test=digest-upgrade`
- Remove test RBAC resources: `oc delete clusterrole clustercurator-limited`
- Verify no orphaned ManagedClusterViews: `oc get managedclusterview -A | grep test`

**Success Criteria:**
- Digest-based upgrades work with force annotation enabled
- Fallback to tag-based upgrades when digests unavailable
- Disconnected environments properly use mirror registries
- RBAC permissions properly enforced and elevated by controller
- No resource conflicts in multi-cluster scenarios
- Error handling provides clear, actionable messages
