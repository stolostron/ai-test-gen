I see you want me to review and improve a test plan while preserving the exact table format. However, I don't see the actual test plan content in your message - only the validation requirements and format preservation instructions.

Could you please provide the test plan that you'd like me to review and improve? I'll need to see the current content to enhance it while maintaining the exact `| Test Steps | Expected Results |` table format.
