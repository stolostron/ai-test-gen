I understand you want me to review and improve a test plan while preserving the exact table format with '| Test Steps | Expected Results |' headers. However, I don't see the actual test plan content in your message that needs to be improved.

Could you please provide the current test plan content that you'd like me to review and enhance? I'll then:

1. Keep the exact '| Test Steps | Expected Results |' format
2. Maintain all markdown table structure 
3. Preserve test case organization and numbering
4. Improve content quality for completeness, clarity, accuracy, and edge case coverage

Please share the test plan content you'd like me to validate and improve.
