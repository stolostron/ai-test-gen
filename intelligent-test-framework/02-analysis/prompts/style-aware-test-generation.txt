I need test cases for ACM-22079 that exactly match my team's specific style and format preferences.

## My Team's Style Samples Available
Please analyze these sample test cases to understand my team's style:
@file:04-implementation/test-style-templates/user-samples/sample-1-unit-test.html
@file:04-implementation/test-style-templates/user-samples/sample-2-integration-test.md
@file:04-implementation/test-style-templates/user-samples/style-preferences-questionnaire.md

## Implementation Context

@file:06-reference/pr-files/ACM-22079-PR-468/hive_test.go

## Style Analysis Instructions

First, please analyze my sample files and identify:

### 1. Format Patterns
- How do I structure test case headers and metadata?
- What table formats do I prefer (HTML tables vs Markdown tables)?
- How do I organize sections (Prerequisites, Steps, Expected Results)?
- What visual elements do I use (emojis, colors, formatting)?

### 2. Language Style  
- What tone do I use (formal, informal, technical)?
- How detailed are my descriptions?
- What terminology and naming conventions do I prefer?
- How do I phrase test steps and validations?

### 3. Content Structure
- How do I handle test metadata (IDs, priorities, components)?
- What level of detail do I include in prerequisites?
- How do I format test steps (numbered, bulleted, phases)?
- How do I present expected results and validation criteria?

### 4. Team-Specific Elements
- What unique elements does my team include?
- How do I handle traceability and references?
- What cleanup and error handling patterns do I use?
- How do I structure technical information?

## Test Generation Request

Based on the EXACT style patterns from my samples, please generate comprehensive test cases for ACM-22079 digest-based upgrades that:

### 1. Perfect Style Match
- Use the EXACT same format as my HTML and Markdown samples
- Follow the same language style and tone
- Include the same types of sections and metadata
- Use the same visual formatting (tables, lists, emphasis)

### 2. Complete Functionality Coverage
- **Digest Discovery**: Test conditionalUpdates and availableUpdates processing
- **Priority Logic**: Verify conditionalUpdates searched before availableUpdates  
- **Fallback Behavior**: Test graceful degradation to tag-based approach
- **Force Flag Logic**: Verify force flag only used for tag-based upgrades
- **Disconnected Environments**: Test air-gapped deployment scenarios
- **Error Handling**: Cover all failure modes and edge cases

### 3. Multiple Test Types (in my team's style)
- **Unit Tests**: Component-level testing (HTML format like sample-1)
- **Integration Tests**: Hub-spoke integration (Markdown format like sample-2)
- **E2E Tests**: Complete workflow testing
- **API Tests**: Backend service validation
- **UI Tests**: Interface and user experience testing

### 4. ACM QE Integration
- Align with existing ACM test automation patterns
- Include appropriate test data and configurations
- Consider Cypress and Go test framework integration
- Reference ACM component interaction patterns

## Output Requirements

Generate 10-15 test cases that:
- ✅ **Look identical** to my team's existing test format
- ✅ **Sound identical** to my team's writing style  
- ✅ **Feel native** to my team's workflow
- ✅ **Cover completely** all ACM-22079 functionality
- ✅ **Include implementation** guidance for ACM automation

## Specific Style Elements to Match

Based on my samples, please replicate:
- **HTML Format**: Rich formatting with CSS, tables, emojis, color coding
- **Markdown Format**: Professional structure with tables, code blocks, clear sections
- **Metadata Handling**: Test IDs, priorities, components, traceability  
- **Technical Detail Level**: Comprehensive but clear explanations
- **Visual Organization**: Clear section headers, organized information flow
- **Validation Approach**: Detailed success criteria and verification methods

The goal is that anyone looking at the generated test cases would think they were written by the same person who created my sample files - perfect style consistency while covering all ACM-22079 requirements.

Please analyze my style samples first, then generate test cases that are indistinguishable from my team's work.
