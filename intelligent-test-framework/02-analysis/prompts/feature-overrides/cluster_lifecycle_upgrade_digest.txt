# Feature-Specific Overrides: Cluster Lifecycle â€” Digest-Based Upgrades

APPLY THESE OVERRIDES TO THE MAIN TABLE-FORMAT PROMPT:

- Scope: ACM-22079-like stories (ClusterCurator digest upgrades)
- Enforce namespace: `ocm` for curator examples/commands
- Include dual CLI/UI variants per step when applicable
- Always provide sample output lines for grep/jsonpath
- Include scenarios: digest via conditionalUpdates, fallback to availableUpdates, tag+force fallback, RBAC, disconnected/mirror, concurrency

Do not alter the mandatory table format. Append concrete command correctness checks and expected outputs to each step.
