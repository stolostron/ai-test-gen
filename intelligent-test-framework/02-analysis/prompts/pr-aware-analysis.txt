I need to analyze ACM-22079 using the actual PR implementation files that are now available locally.

## PR Access
Please reference these local files for the actual implementation:
@file:06-reference/pr-files/ACM-22079-PR-468/pr-summary.md
@file:06-reference/pr-files/ACM-22079-PR-468/hive.go
@file:06-reference/pr-files/ACM-22079-PR-468/hive_test.go

## Analysis Request
Based on the actual PR files above, provide:

1. **Detailed Implementation Analysis**:
   - Examine the actual validateUpgradeVersion function changes
   - Analyze the retreiveAndUpdateClusterVersion modifications
   - Review the digest discovery algorithm implementation
   - Understand the test case implementations

2. **Code-Specific Insights**:
   - How does the actual conditionalUpdates processing work?
   - What's the exact logic for digest vs tag-based image selection?
   - How are the test cases structured and what do they validate?
   - What error handling patterns are implemented?

3. **Test Case Generation**:
   - Based on the actual test implementations, generate additional test scenarios
   - Create test cases that complement the existing ones
   - Focus on edge cases and error conditions not covered

4. **Implementation Recommendations**:
   - How to integrate these findings into ACM QE test automation
   - Specific test data requirements based on actual implementation
   - CI/CD considerations based on the actual code structure

## Context
This is for ACM QE test automation development. The analysis should be based on the actual implementation code, not just the JIRA description.

Please reference the specific files and code sections in your analysis.
