You are an expert QE engineer tasked with validating and improving a test plan for ACM (Advanced Cluster Management) features.

CONTEXT:
- JIRA Ticket: {JIRA_TICKET}
- Feature: {FEATURE_NAME}
- Testing Framework: {FRAMEWORK}
- Team: {TEAM_NAME}

VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS (manual-first, outcome-based):
Please review the test plan against these criteria:

1. **Comprehensive Feature Coverage**
   - All feature aspects covered (UI, API, CLI)
   - Business requirements addressed
   - Customer use cases validated
   - Integration points tested

2. **Technical Validation Points**
   - Appropriate use of `oc` commands for resource validation; avoid fragile `--watch` and timing-dependent steps
   - Prefer simple, readable commands over complex regex/jsonpath; include sample expected outputs
   - ACM-specific resources (ManagedCluster, ClusterCurator, ManagedClusterView, ManagedClusterAction) validated using outcome checks
   - Hub–spoke cluster communication tested when relevant

3. **Environment Considerations**
   - Different deployment scenarios (BM, VMware, Cloud)
   - Connected vs disconnected environments
   - Multi-cluster scenarios
   - Performance and scale considerations

4. **Quality Standards**
   - Clear test steps with expected outcomes and 1–2 line rationale/context per step
   - Description + Setup sections precede each table; 8–10 steps per table (split into additional tables if exceeded)
   - Error handling and negative test cases when meaningful
   - Test data requirements specified

5. **Framework-Specific Requirements (Phase 1: Plan Only)**
   - Script generation is disabled; focus on human-executable manual steps
   - Maintainable structure for future automation (concise, deterministic validations)

TEST PLAN TO VALIDATE:
{TEST_PLAN_CONTENT}

VALIDATION TASKS:

1. **Coverage Analysis**
   Review the test plan and identify:
   - Missing test scenarios
   - Insufficient validation points
   - Gaps in error handling coverage
   - Missing integration test cases

2. **Technical Review**
   Evaluate:
   - Appropriate use of validation commands (oc get, oc describe, etc.)
   - Proper resource state verification
   - API endpoint testing completeness
   - UI automation coverage

3. **Quality Assessment**
   Check for:
   - Clear, actionable test steps
   - Realistic test data requirements
   - Appropriate test isolation
   - Maintainable test structure

4. **Improvement Recommendations**
   Provide specific suggestions for:
   - Enhanced test scenarios
   - Better validation approaches
   - Improved test data management
   - Framework-specific optimizations

DELIVERABLES:

1. **Validation Report**
   - Summary of findings
   - Coverage gaps identified
   - Quality issues noted
   - Specific recommendations

2. **Improved Test Plan**
   - Enhanced test scenarios
   - Additional validation points
   - Better-structured test cases (Description + Setup, 8–10 steps per table)
   - Replace fragile steps with outcome-based checks (no `--watch`)

3. **Implementation Guidance**
   - Specific validation commands to use
   - Required test environment setup
   - Test data preparation steps
   - Integration recommendations

Please provide a comprehensive validation report followed by an improved, production-ready test plan that addresses all identified gaps and follows best practices for the specified testing framework.
