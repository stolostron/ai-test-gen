# Claude Configuration - AI Systems Modular QE Suite

> **Global Claude slash commands for enterprise QE automation across modular AI-powered applications**

## üéØ Universal Access - Work from Anywhere

**üåü Intelligent Routing**: You can work from the root directory without navigating to specific apps. Claude automatically routes your requests to the appropriate application and uses their specialized capabilities.

### Natural Language Commands (Recommended)
```bash
# Claude intelligently routes these to the right app:
"Analyze ACM-22079"                                    # ‚Üí claude-test-generator V3.0
"Analyze pipeline failure: [JENKINS_URL]"             # ‚Üí z-stream-analysis  
"Generate test plan for ACM feature X"                # ‚Üí claude-test-generator V3.0
"Debug Jenkins build failure in job Y"                # ‚Üí z-stream-analysis
```

### Explicit Global Slash Commands
These commands work from anywhere in the repository and provide quick access to common QE automation workflows across all applications.

### /generate-e2e-test-plan

**Description:** Generate comprehensive E2E test plans for ACM features using AI-powered analysis with Red Hat ACM official documentation intelligence and deployment validation.

**Usage:** `/generate-e2e-test-plan {PR_URL} {FEATURE_NAME} [JIRA_SOURCE]`

**Example:**
`/generate-e2e-test-plan https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123 "Feature Name" ACM-10659`

**Powered by:** [`claude-test-generator`](./apps/claude-test-generator/) V3.0 - Enterprise AI Services Integration with Red Hat ACM Documentation Intelligence

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ **AI Investigation Protocol**: Complete JIRA hierarchy + Enhanced GitHub PR analysis (smart `gh` CLI detection) + Red Hat ACM documentation + deployment analysis
- ‚úÖ **üìö Official Documentation Intelligence**: Red Hat ACM docs (stolostron/rhacm-docs) as primary source
- ‚úÖ **Evidence-Based Validation**: Concrete deployment status with behavioral testing
- ‚úÖ **Production-Ready Output**: Copy-paste terminal commands with realistic sample outputs
- ‚úÖ **Category-Aware Quality**: 85-95+ point targets with intelligent validation

**Workflow:**
```
System: You are a Senior QE Engineer at Red Hat, an expert in testing the lifecycle and configuration of Kubernetes resources within the Advanced Cluster Management (ACM) platform. Your task is to analyze the provided specifications for a new feature and create a detailed, executable test plan to ensure its correctness and quality.

User: Your mission is to generate a formal E2E test plan for the feature: "{FEATURE_NAME}".

CONTEXT GATHERING:
1. Fetch PR at {PR_URL} details and associated test specifications
2. If {JIRA_SOURCE} is provided, treat it as a JIRA key and fetch details (when supported)
3. Analyze Red Hat ACM official documentation (stolostron/rhacm-docs) for authoritative feature information
4. Review architectural documentation and related files if provided
5. Use E2E Acceptance Criteria in JIRA to create the test plan

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
- Use Pull Request Test Specification as primary source of truth
- Leverage Red Hat ACM official documentation for authoritative feature understanding
- Incorporate architectural and business context from other documents if provided
- Focus on Kubernetes resource lifecycle testing within ACM platform
- Ensure coverage of all defined E2E scenarios with documentation-validated approaches

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Your entire response MUST only contain the markdown table requested below. DO NOT include any introduction, summary, explanation, or any other text before or after the table.

Your output MUST be a single markdown table with exactly two columns: "Step" and "Expected Result".

CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- ‚úÖ **2-Column Format ONLY**: Never create 3-column tables (Step | Action | Expected Result)
- ‚úÖ **Step Column Content**: Include verbal instructions + full commands (e.g., "**Step 1: Log into the ACM hub cluster** - Access the hub cluster using credentials: `oc login https://api.cluster.example.com:6443 --username=kubeadmin --password=<password>`")
- ‚úÖ **Full Commands Required**: Provide complete commands with proper placeholders, not generic `<cluster-url>`
- ‚úÖ **Expected Result Content**: Include verbal explanations + sample outputs in code blocks for all data fetch/update operations
- ‚úÖ **NO HTML Tags**: Never use `<br/>`, `<b>`, `<i>` - use proper markdown formatting only

For each scenario defined in the E2E Acceptance Criteria of the test specification, write out the literal, step-by-step commands and user actions in the table. Do not summarize the scenarios; generate the table steps for them.

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
Your generated test plan MUST satisfy all scenarios defined in the E2E Acceptance Criteria section of the Pull Request Test Specification from {PR_URL}.

Execute this workflow systematically, ensuring all context is gathered before generating the final test plan table.

SAVE OUTPUT:
Generated test plans are saved within the application-specific runs directories for organized tracking and version control.
```
