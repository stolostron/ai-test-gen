## üöÄ Usage

### Smart Proxy Router (Root Access)
```bash
# Complete app functionality from root directory:
/test-generator Generate test plan for ACM-22079  # Example usage
/z-stream-analysis Analyze https://jenkins-url/job/pipeline/123/
```

### Direct Navigation
```bash
# Traditional app navigation:
cd apps/claude-test-generator/
"Generate test plan for ACM-22079"  # Example command
```

**Both methods provide equivalent functionality** with Smart Proxy Router offering transparent context injection while maintaining strict app isolation.
