## 🚀 Quick Start

### Method 1: Direct Navigation (Recommended)
```bash
# Test Generation (ACM features):
cd apps/claude-test-generator/
"Generate test plan for ACM-22079"
"Analyze PR: https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123"

# Pipeline Analysis (Jenkins failures):
cd apps/z-stream-analysis/  
"Analyze https://jenkins-url/job/pipeline/123/"
"Investigate clc-e2e-pipeline-3313"
```

### Method 2: Global Routing
```bash
# Quick routing from root directory:
/test-generator Generate test plan for ACM-22079
/pipeline-analysis Analyze https://jenkins-url/job/pipeline/123/
```

## 🏗️ Isolation Architecture

**Complete App Independence:** Achieved through enterprise-grade isolation design:

### Core Principles
- **Zero Context Contamination**: Claude never mixes up which app you're using
- **Complete Self-Containment**: Each app works without knowledge of others
- **Prefixed AI Services**: `tg_` (test-generator) and `pa_` (pipeline-analysis) namespacing
- **Independent Configurations**: 124-line global config vs. previous 2,700+ line monolith

### App Structure
```
apps/your-app/
├── .app-config              # App identity and isolation rules
├── CLAUDE.md               # Self-contained configuration with isolation headers
├── .claude/                # App-specific AI services (prefixed)
├── runs/                   # Independent results storage
└── docs/                   # App-specific documentation
```

### Benefits
- **Team Ownership**: Different teams can own different apps without conflicts
- **Parallel Development**: Work on apps simultaneously without interference  
- **Easy Extension**: Add unlimited apps following standard patterns
- **Maintenance Safety**: Update one app without affecting others

## 📊 Architecture Improvements

**Transformation Results:**
- **95% reduction** in global configuration complexity (2,700+ → 124 lines)
- **100% elimination** of cross-app contamination (47+ → 0 references)
- **Zero AI service conflicts** through proper prefixing
- **Complete functionality preservation** of all V3.1 enterprise features

## 🔧 Adding New Applications

Follow the proven isolation pattern:

1. **Create App Directory**: `apps/your-app-name/`
2. **Add App Config**: `.app-config` with unique name and AI service prefix
3. **Create Isolated CLAUDE.md**: Include isolation headers and self-contained logic
4. **Implement AI Services**: Use unique prefix for all service files
5. **Verify Isolation**: Test independence using verification guidelines
6. **Update Global**: Add basic app description to this file

**Template Available**: `shared/templates/app-extension-guide.md` provides complete step-by-step instructions
