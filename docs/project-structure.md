# Project Structure & Extension Guide

> **How to understand, extend, and contribute to the AI Systems suite**

This document explains the architecture, design principles, and extension patterns for the AI Systems modular QE automation suite.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Philosophy
The AI Systems suite is built on **modular independence** - each application is completely self-contained and can function without any other app. This creates a robust, extensible foundation for building AI-powered QE tools.

### Repository Structure
```

## 🎯 Design Principles

### 1. Complete Independence
Each application in `apps/` is **fully self-contained**:
- ✅ **No shared dependencies** between apps
- ✅ **Independent CLAUDE.md** configurations
- ✅ **Separate documentation** and examples
- ✅ **Isolated data storage** (runs/, logs/, outputs/)
- ✅ **Individual maintenance** cycles

### 2. Claude AI Integration
Every app leverages Claude's capabilities through a **layered configuration**:
- **Global commands** (`/generate-e2e-test-plan`, `/analyze-workflow`) work everywhere
- **App-specific prompts** in each app's `CLAUDE.md` provide specialized behavior
- **Domain expertise** embedded in prompts for targeted use cases

### 3. User Experience Focus
- **Natural language interaction** - users talk to Claude, not complex CLIs
- **5-10 minute setup** from zero to productive
- **Copy-paste ready outputs** - no manual modification needed
- **Clear documentation** with real examples

### 4. Extensibility by Design
- **Template-driven** - copy existing app structure for new apps
- **Configuration-based** - behavior driven by CLAUDE.md, not code
- **Minimal barriers** - anyone can add a new app
- **Gradual adoption** - teams adopt apps independently

## 📋 Application Structure Template

Every app follows this consistent structure:

```
apps/your-new-app/
├── CLAUDE.md                        # App-specific Claude configuration
├── README.md                        # User-facing documentation  
├── docs/                           # Detailed guides (optional)
│   ├── quick-start.md
│   └── advanced-features.md
├── runs/ or outputs/               # Generated artifacts
├── examples/                       # Sample outputs
├── templates/ (optional)           # Reusable templates
└── scripts/ (optional)            # Automation scripts
```

### Required Files

#### 1. `CLAUDE.md` - App Configuration
This is the **heart of each app** - it defines how Claude behaves in this context.

**Template structure**:
```markdown
# [App Name] - Claude Configuration

## Context & Purpose
Brief description of what this app does and when to use it.

## System Prompt
The core AI instructions that define the app's behavior.

## Available Tools  
What tools and capabilities the app has access to.

## Workflow Patterns
Common usage patterns and slash commands.

## Output Standards
Quality requirements and format specifications.
```

#### 2. `README.md` - User Documentation
**Template structure**:
```markdown
# [App Name]

> **One-line description of what this app does**

## Quick Start
1. Navigate to app
2. Ask Claude to do X
3. Get results

## What You Get
- Key benefits
- Output format
- Quality metrics

## Examples
Real usage examples with commands and expected outputs.

## Advanced Features
Optional advanced capabilities.
```

### Optional Directories

- **`docs/`** - Detailed documentation for complex workflows
- **`runs/` or `outputs/`** - Where the app stores generated artifacts
- **`examples/`** - Sample outputs and templates for users
- **`templates/`** - Reusable templates for the app's domain
- **`scripts/`** - Automation scripts (must be self-contained)

## 🚀 Creating a New Application

### Step 1: Plan Your App

**Ask yourself**:
- What specific QE problem does this solve?
- Who is the target user?
- What would success look like?
- How long should it take to get value?

### Step 2: Create the Structure

```bash
# Create new app directory
mkdir apps/your-app-name
cd apps/your-app-name

# Create required files
touch CLAUDE.md README.md

# Create optional directories
mkdir docs runs examples
```

### Step 3: Configure Claude Behavior

Edit `CLAUDE.md` to define:
1. **System prompt** - how Claude should behave in this context
2. **Available tools** - what capabilities the app provides
3. **Workflow patterns** - common usage scenarios
4. **Quality standards** - output requirements

### Step 4: Document User Experience

Edit `README.md` to provide:
1. **Quick start** - 3 steps to value
2. **Clear examples** - real commands and outputs
3. **Key benefits** - why use this vs manual work
4. **Documentation links** - where to learn more

### Step 5: Test and Iterate

1. **Test the user flow** - can someone else use it easily?
2. **Validate outputs** - do results meet quality standards?
3. **Gather feedback** - improve based on real usage
4. **Document lessons learned** - update guides

### Step 6: Integrate with Suite

1. **Update root README.md** - add your app to the main documentation
2. **Add global commands** (optional) - if your app provides repo-wide value
3. **Share with team** - promote adoption and gather feedback

## 🔧 Extension Patterns

### Pattern 1: Domain-Specific Testing
**Use case**: Specialized testing for a specific ACM area (security, performance, UI)

**Structure**:
```
apps/acm-security-testing/
├── CLAUDE.md              # Security testing prompts
├── templates/
│   ├── cve-analysis.md
│   ├── penetration-test.md
│   └── compliance-check.md
└── runs/
    └── CVE-2024-XXXX/     # CVE-specific analysis
```

### Pattern 2: Analysis & Reporting
**Use case**: Automated analysis of logs, failures, or data

**Structure**:
```
apps/log-analysis/
├── CLAUDE.md              # Log analysis prompts
├── parsers/               # Log parsing utilities
├── templates/
│   └── incident-report.md
└── reports/               # Generated analysis reports
```

### Pattern 3: Automation & Orchestration
**Use case**: Complex workflow automation with AI decision-making

**Structure**:
```
apps/test-orchestrator/
├── CLAUDE.md              # Orchestration prompts
├── workflows/             # Workflow definitions
├── environments/          # Environment configurations
└── executions/            # Execution logs and results
```

### Pattern 4: Documentation & Knowledge
**Use case**: AI-powered documentation generation and knowledge management

**Structure**:
```
apps/docs-assistant/
├── CLAUDE.md              # Documentation prompts
├── templates/
│   ├── feature-docs.md
│   ├── troubleshooting.md
│   └── api-docs.md
└── generated/             # Auto-generated documentation
```

## 🔄 Integration Points

### Global Commands
Some apps may provide **global slash commands** that work from anywhere in the repository. These are defined in the root `CLAUDE.md`.

**When to add global commands**:
- ✅ Command provides value across multiple apps
- ✅ Workflow is common and frequently used
- ✅ Command doesn't conflict with app-specific behavior

**How to add**:
1. Define command in root `CLAUDE.md`
2. Reference the specific app that handles the command
3. Document in root README.md

### Shared Documentation
Common patterns and configurations go in `docs/`:
- **Setup guides** for tools used by multiple apps
- **Integration patterns** for connecting with external systems
- **Best practices** for AI prompt engineering
- **Troubleshooting** for common issues

### Cross-App Learning
While apps are independent, they can **learn from each other**:
- **Prompt patterns** that work well in one app
- **Quality standards** that ensure consistent outputs
- **User experience patterns** that improve adoption
- **Claude configuration techniques** that enhance AI behavior

## 📊 Quality Standards

### App-Level Quality
Each app should meet these standards:
- **< 10 minute setup** from discovery to first successful use
- **Clear value proposition** - users understand why to use it
- **Reliable outputs** - consistent quality and format
- **Good documentation** - examples and troubleshooting

### Suite-Level Quality
The overall suite should maintain:
- **Consistent user experience** across apps
- **No conflicts** between apps or global commands
- **Clear navigation** - users know which app to use when
- **Maintainable architecture** - easy to add/remove/update apps

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### For New Apps
- **Time to first value** < 10 minutes
- **User adoption** within target team
- **Quality of outputs** meets domain standards
- **Maintenance burden** is reasonable

### For the Suite
- **Number of apps** actively used
- **Cross-team adoption** of different apps
- **Time savings** across QE workflows
- **Quality improvements** in QE outputs

## 🤝 Contributing Guidelines

### Before Creating a New App
1. **Check existing apps** - could your use case be handled by extending an existing app?
2. **Validate the need** - talk to potential users
3. **Plan the scope** - start small and focused
4. **Consider maintenance** - who will maintain this long-term?

### Development Process
1. **Create feature branch** for your app
2. **Follow the template structure**
3. **Test with real use cases**
4. **Document thoroughly**
5. **Get feedback** before merging
6. **Plan maintenance and updates**

### Review Criteria
- ✅ **Independence** - app works without other apps
- ✅ **Documentation** - clear README and examples
- ✅ **Value** - solves real QE problem efficiently
- ✅ **Quality** - outputs meet professional standards
- ✅ **Maintenance** - reasonable ongoing maintenance needs
