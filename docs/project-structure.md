## 🎯 Isolation Design Principles

### 1. Complete Independence (V3.1)
Each application in `apps/` is **completely isolated**:
- ✅ **Zero Context Contamination**: Claude never mixes up which app you're using
- ✅ **Complete Self-Containment**: Each app works without knowledge of others
- ✅ **Prefixed AI Services**: `tg_` (test-generator) and `pa_` (pipeline-analysis) namespacing
- ✅ **Independent Configurations**: App-specific .app-config files with isolation rules
- ✅ **Isolated Working Directories**: Enforced through isolation headers

### 2. Enterprise-Grade Architecture
Transformation from monolithic to isolated design:
- **95% reduction** in global configuration complexity (2,700+ → 124 lines)
- **100% elimination** of cross-app contamination (47+ → 0 references)
- **Zero AI service conflicts** through proper prefixing
- **Complete functionality preservation** of all V3.1 enterprise features

### 3. App Structure Standards
Every app follows the isolation pattern:
```
apps/your-app/
├── .app-config              # App identity and isolation rules
├── CLAUDE.md               # Self-contained configuration with isolation headers
├── .claude/                # App-specific AI services (prefixed)
├── runs/                   # Independent results storage
└── docs/                   # App-specific documentation
```

### 4. Usage Patterns (V3.1)
- **Method 1: Direct Navigation** (Recommended): `cd apps/your-app/` then natural language
- **Method 2: Global Routing**: `/app-name command` from root directory
- **Complete Isolation**: No cross-app interference or configuration bleeding

## 📋 Application Structure Template

Every app follows this consistent structure:

```
apps/your-new-app/
├── CLAUDE.md                        # App-specific Claude configuration
├── README.md                        # User-facing documentation  
├── docs/                           # Detailed guides (optional)
│   ├── quick-start.md
│   └── advanced-features.md
├── runs/ or outputs/               # Generated artifacts
├── examples/                       # Sample outputs
├── templates/ (optional)           # Reusable templates

## 🚀 Creating a New Application (V3.1 Isolation Pattern)

### Step 1: Follow Isolation Pattern

**Required Files**:
1. **Create App Directory**: `apps/your-app-name/`
2. **Add App Config**: `.app-config` with unique name and AI service prefix
3. **Create Isolated CLAUDE.md**: Include isolation headers and self-contained logic
4. **Implement AI Services**: Use unique prefix for all service files
5. **Verify Isolation**: Test independence using verification guidelines
6. **Update Global**: Add basic app description to root CLAUDE.md

**Template Available**: `shared/templates/app-extension-guide.md` provides complete step-by-step instructions

### Step 2: Implement Isolation Requirements

**Mandatory Isolation Rules**:
- No cross-app references
- Self-contained configuration
- Prefixed AI services
- Independent working directory
- Isolated results storage

**Verification Pattern**:
```bash
# Test isolation compliance
cd apps/your-app-name/
grep -r "../" .                    # Should find no parent references
grep -r "apps/" .                  # Should find no cross-app references
```

### Step 3: Maintain Enterprise Standards

**Quality Requirements**:
- Complete independence from other apps
- Preserved functionality with isolation
- Standard patterns following existing apps
- Comprehensive documentation
- Verification of isolation compliance

## 🔧 Extension Patterns

### Pattern 1: Domain-Specific Testing
**Use case**: Specialized testing for a specific ACM area (security, performance, UI)

**Structure**:
```
apps/acm-security-testing/
├── CLAUDE.md              # Security testing prompts
├── templates/
│   ├── cve-analysis.md
│   ├── penetration-test.md
│   └── compliance-check.md
└── runs/
    └── CVE-2024-XXXX/     # CVE-specific analysis
```

### Pattern 2: Analysis & Reporting
**Use case**: Automated analysis of logs, failures, or data

**Structure**:
```
apps/log-analysis/
├── CLAUDE.md              # Log analysis prompts
├── parsers/               # Log parsing utilities
├── templates/
│   └── incident-report.md
└── reports/               # Generated analysis reports
```

### Pattern 3: Automation & Orchestration
**Use case**: Complex workflow automation with AI decision-making

**Structure**:
```
apps/test-orchestrator/
├── CLAUDE.md              # Orchestration prompts
├── workflows/             # Workflow definitions
├── environments/          # Environment configurations
└── executions/            # Execution logs and results
```

### Pattern 4: Documentation & Knowledge
**Use case**: AI-powered documentation generation and knowledge management

│   ├── troubleshooting.md
│   └── api-docs.md
└── generated/             # Auto-generated documentation
```

## 🔄 Integration Points

### Global Commands
Some apps may provide **global slash commands** that work from anywhere in the repository. These are defined in the root `CLAUDE.md`.

**When to add global commands**:
- ✅ Command provides value across multiple apps
- ✅ Workflow is common and frequently used
- ✅ Command doesn't conflict with app-specific behavior

**How to add**:
1. Define command in root `CLAUDE.md`
2. Reference the specific app that handles the command
3. Document in root README.md

### Shared Documentation
Common patterns and configurations go in `docs/`:
- **Setup guides** for tools used by multiple apps
- **Integration patterns** for connecting with external systems
- **Best practices** for AI prompt engineering
- **Troubleshooting** for common issues

### Cross-App Learning
While apps are independent, they can **learn from each other**:
- **Prompt patterns** that work well in one app
- **Quality standards** that ensure consistent outputs
- **User experience patterns** that improve adoption
- **Claude configuration techniques** that enhance AI behavior

## 📊 Quality Standards

### App-Level Quality
Each app should meet these standards:
- **< 10 minute setup** from discovery to first successful use
- **Clear value proposition** - users understand why to use it
- **Reliable outputs** - consistent quality and format
- **Good documentation** - examples and troubleshooting

### Suite-Level Quality
The overall suite should maintain:
- **Consistent user experience** across apps
- **No conflicts** between apps or global commands
- **Clear navigation** - users know which app to use when
- **Maintainable architecture** - easy to add/remove/update apps
