## üîß Setup & Configuration

### Quick Start Requirements
1. **Claude Code CLI** configured and authenticated
2. **JIRA access** with API token (see [JIRA_API_SETUP.md](JIRA_API_SETUP.md))
3. **kubectl/oc** for cluster operations
4. **Git access** for repository analysis

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Basic setup
git clone <repository>
cd ai_systems

# Set JIRA credentials (see JIRA_API_SETUP.md)
export JIRA_USERNAME="your.email@company.com"
export JIRA_API_TOKEN="your_api_token"

# Ready to use - try either method:
"Generate test plan for ACM-22079"  # Smart Proxy Router
# OR
cd apps/claude-test-generator/ && "Generate test plan for ACM-22079"  # Direct navigation
```

## üöÄ Usage Patterns

### Smart Proxy Router (Recommended)
Work from anywhere with natural language:
```bash
"Generate test plan for ACM-22079"
"Analyze PR: https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123"
"Debug Jenkins pipeline failure"
```

### Direct Navigation
Navigate to specific applications:
```bash
cd apps/claude-test-generator/
"Create comprehensive tests for new cluster management feature"

cd apps/z-stream-analysis/
"Analyze https://jenkins-url/job/pipeline/123/"
```

### Framework Observability
Monitor execution in real-time:
```bash
./.claude/observability/observe /status      # Current progress
./.claude/observability/observe /business    # Customer impact
./.claude/observability/observe /technical   # Implementation details
```
