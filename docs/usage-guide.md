# AI Systems Suite - Usage Guide

> **Comprehensive guide for using the AI Systems Suite with Smart Proxy Router and direct navigation**

This guide covers all usage patterns, commands, and best practices for working with the AI Systems Suite applications.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Claude Code CLI** configured and authenticated
- **JIRA access** for ticket analysis (test generator applications)
- **kubectl/oc** for cluster operations and environment data collection
- **Git access** for repository analysis and investigation

### Basic Usage Patterns

#### Method 1: Smart Proxy Router (Recommended)
Work from anywhere in the repository using natural language with automatic routing:

```bash
# From root directory - AI automatically routes to appropriate app
"Generate test plan for ACM-22079"
"Analyze PR: https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123"  
"Debug Jenkins pipeline failure: https://jenkins-url/job/pipeline/123/"
"Investigate clc-e2e-pipeline-3313"
```

#### Method 2: Direct Navigation
Navigate directly to applications for focused work:

```bash
# Test Generator
cd apps/claude-test-generator/
"Generate test plan for ACM-22079"
"Analyze feature deployment for ACM-22620"

# Z-Stream Analysis  
cd apps/z-stream-analysis/
"Analyze https://jenkins-url/job/pipeline/123/"
"Debug automation failure in clc-e2e-pipeline"
```

**Both methods provide 100% equivalent functionality** with Smart Proxy Router offering transparent context injection while maintaining strict app isolation.

‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ACM-22079-20250823-170246/    # Timestamped run directories
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ACM-22079-20250824-091502/    # Multiple runs per ticket
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ latest -> ACM-22079-20250824-091502    # Latest symlink
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ACM-22620/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ACM-22620-20250824-143020/
