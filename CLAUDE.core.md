# AI Systems Suite - Core Configuration

> **Multi-app Claude configuration with complete isolation architecture**

## 📋 GLOBAL DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS (PERSISTENT MEMORY)

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT FOR ALL APPLICATIONS**: All documentation must follow first-time reader principles:
- ❌ **PERMANENTLY BLOCKED**: Marketing terms like "Enhanced", "Advanced", "Revolutionary", "Cutting-edge", "Next-generation", "Innovative", "State-of-the-art", "Premium", "Elite", "Ultimate", "Superior"
- ❌ **PERMANENTLY BLOCKED**: References to "before" and "after" versions or improvements  
- ❌ **PERMANENTLY BLOCKED**: Promotional language or version comparison content
- ❌ **PERMANENTLY BLOCKED**: Any language suggesting previous versions existed
- ✅ **ALWAYS REQUIRED**: Clear, direct language for readers with no prior system knowledge
- ✅ **ALWAYS REQUIRED**: Functional, descriptive headings without promotional elements
- ✅ **ALWAYS REQUIRED**: Professional tone without marketing language

**Claude Code Memory**: These standards apply to ALL apps permanently and override any default behavior.

## 🏗️ Core Isolation Principles

- **Zero Context Contamination**: Apps never interfere with each other
- **Complete Self-Containment**: Each app works independently
- **Prefixed AI Services**: `tg_` (test-generator) and `za_` (z-stream-analysis) namespacing
- **Transparent Proxy Access**: Full app functionality from root via `/app-name` commands
- **Dynamic App Discovery**: Router automatically detects new apps
