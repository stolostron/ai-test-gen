### Core AI Service Implementation

```
AI ROUTING DECISION ENGINE:

REQUEST ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:
â”œâ”€â”€ Semantic Understanding: Natural language processing of user intent
â”œâ”€â”€ Context Awareness: Previous conversation history and patterns
â”œâ”€â”€ Domain Classification: ACM testing vs CI/CD troubleshooting analysis
â”œâ”€â”€ Confidence Scoring: ML-based probability assessment
â”œâ”€â”€ Learning Loop: Continuous improvement from user feedback
â””â”€â”€ Fallback Strategy: Graceful degradation to user choice
```

### Intelligent Classification Logic

#### Phase 1: Semantic Intent Analysis
```
INTENT_CLASSIFIER_AI_SERVICE:

Input: User natural language request
Process: 
1. DOMAIN_ANALYSIS
   â”œâ”€â”€ Extract key entities: ACM components, JIRA tickets, GitHub PRs, Jenkins URLs
   â”œâ”€â”€ Identify action types: generate, test, analyze, debug, investigate
   â”œâ”€â”€ Recognize workflow patterns: testing vs troubleshooting vs analysis
   â””â”€â”€ Assess technical depth: surface-level vs deep technical investigation

2. CONTEXTUAL_UNDERSTANDING
   â”œâ”€â”€ Parse technical terminology (ClusterCurator, MCH, Jenkins pipeline)
   â”œâ”€â”€ Understand relationship patterns (ticket â†’ test plan, failure â†’ analysis)
   â”œâ”€â”€ Recognize user goal alignment with app capabilities
   â””â”€â”€ Consider conversation history for context continuity

3. CONFIDENCE_CALCULATION
   â”œâ”€â”€ High (90%+): Clear single app alignment
   â”œâ”€â”€ Medium (70-89%): Strong indication but some ambiguity
   â”œâ”€â”€ Low (50-69%): Multiple possible interpretations
   â””â”€â”€ Unclear (<50%): Insufficient information for routing decision
```

### Implementation Examples

#### Example 1: High-Confidence Routing
```
User Input: "I need to validate the new cluster management feature for ACM-22079 deployment"

AI Analysis:
â”œâ”€â”€ Domain: ACM ecosystem (weight: 0.9)
â”œâ”€â”€ Action: Validation/testing (weight: 0.85)
â”œâ”€â”€ Entity: ACM ticket number (weight: 0.95)
â”œâ”€â”€ Context: Feature testing workflow (weight: 0.8)
â””â”€â”€ Confidence: 92%

Decision: Auto-route to test-generator
Response: "ðŸŽ¯ Routing to test-generator for ACM feature validation (92% confidence)"
```

#### Example 2: Learning from Correction
```
User Input: "Debug the cluster creation automation"
Initial AI Decision: test-generator (75% confidence)
User Correction: "Actually, this is about Jenkins pipeline issues"
User Choice: z-stream-analysis

Learning Update:
â”œâ”€â”€ Pattern: "debug automation" + pipeline context â†’ z-stream-analysis
â”œâ”€â”€ Weight adjustment: Increase CI/CD indicators for "automation debug"
â”œâ”€â”€ User preference: This user associates "automation" with pipeline issues
â””â”€â”€ Future improvement: Better context questioning for ambiguous terms
```

#### Example 3: Intelligent Clarification
```
User Input: "Help me with the cluster deployment issue"

AI Analysis:
â”œâ”€â”€ Domain: Mixed (ACM cluster + deployment issues)
â”œâ”€â”€ Ambiguity: Could be testing validation OR pipeline failure
â”œâ”€â”€ Context needed: Type of issue, stage of deployment
â””â”€â”€ Confidence: 45%

Response: "ðŸ¤” I can help with cluster deployment issues. To route you to the best specialist:
1. **Test Generator** - If you need to validate cluster features or create test plans
2. **Z-Stream Analysis** - If you're debugging CI/CD pipeline or automation failures
3. **More context** - Tell me more about the specific issue

What type of deployment issue are you facing?"
