# AI Systems Suite

> **Enterprise multi-app Claude configuration with complete isolation architecture**

A modular enterprise automation suite featuring completely isolated AI applications for QE teams. Each app operates independently with zero cross-contamination, enabling infinite scalability and team ownership.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Method 1: Direct Navigation (Recommended)
```bash
# Test Generation (ACM features):
cd apps/claude-test-generator/
"Generate test plan for ACM-22079"
"Analyze PR: https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123"

# Pipeline Analysis (Jenkins failures):
cd apps/z-stream-analysis/  
"Analyze https://jenkins-url/job/pipeline/123/"
"Investigate clc-e2e-pipeline-3313"
```

### Method 2: Global Routing
```bash
# Quick routing from root directory:
/test-generator Generate test plan for ACM-22079
/pipeline-analysis Analyze https://jenkins-url/job/pipeline/123/
```

| **Debug Jenkins failures** | `z-stream-analysis` | Pipeline failed, need root cause analysis |
| **Validate deployments** | `claude-test-generator` | Check if feature is actually deployed |
| **Fix CI/CD issues** | `z-stream-analysis` | Automation scripts breaking, need fixes |

## 🏗️ Isolation Architecture

**Complete App Independence:** Achieved through enterprise-grade isolation design:

### Core Principles
- **Zero Context Contamination**: Claude never mixes up which app you're using
- **Complete Self-Containment**: Each app works without knowledge of others
- **Prefixed AI Services**: `tg_` (test-generator) and `pa_` (pipeline-analysis) namespacing
- **Independent Configurations**: 124-line global config vs. previous 2,700+ line monolith

### App Structure
```
apps/your-app/
├── .app-config              # App identity and isolation rules
├── CLAUDE.md               # Self-contained configuration with isolation headers
├── .claude/                # App-specific AI services (prefixed)
├── runs/                   # Independent results storage
└── docs/                   # App-specific documentation
```

### Benefits
- **Team Ownership**: Different teams can own different apps without conflicts
- **Parallel Development**: Work on apps simultaneously without interference  
- **Easy Extension**: Add unlimited apps following standard patterns
- **Maintenance Safety**: Update one app without affecting others

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Claude Code CLI** configured and authenticated
- **GitHub access** to relevant repositories (if not public)
- **kubectl/oc** for cluster operations (test generator)
- **JIRA access** for ticket analysis (test generator)

### 2-Step Setup
1. **Clone the repo** 
2. **Ask Claude** to perform your task using natural language

### Available Commands
```bash
# Direct app navigation (recommended)
cd apps/claude-test-generator/
"Generate test plan for ACM-22079"

cd apps/z-stream-analysis/
"Analyze https://jenkins-url/job/pipeline/123/"

# Global routing commands
/test-generator Generate test plan for ACM-22079
/pipeline-analysis Analyze https://jenkins-url/job/pipeline/123/
```

## 🔧 Adding New Applications

Follow the proven isolation pattern:

1. **Create App Directory**: `apps/your-app-name/`
2. **Add App Config**: `.app-config` with unique name and AI service prefix
3. **Create Isolated CLAUDE.md**: Include isolation headers and self-contained logic
4. **Implement AI Services**: Use unique prefix for all service files
5. **Verify Isolation**: Test independence using verification guidelines
6. **Update Global**: Add basic app description to this file

**Template Available**: `shared/templates/app-extension-guide.md` provides complete step-by-step instructions

### Example Future Apps We Could Add

#### ACM Security Testing Suite
```bash
apps/acm-security-scanner/
├── CLAUDE.md              # Security-focused prompts
├── README.md              # Security testing workflows  
└── templates/             # CVE analysis templates
```
**Use case**: Automated security vulnerability scanning, CVE analysis, compliance testing

└── baselines/             # Historical performance data
```
**Use case**: Generate performance baselines, detect regressions, capacity planning

#### Documentation Assistant
```bash
apps/docs-generator/
├── CLAUDE.md              # Documentation generation prompts
├── templates/             # Doc templates for features

├── providers/             # AWS, Azure, GCP configurations
└── scenarios/             # Cross-cloud test scenarios
```
**Use case**: Test ACM across different cloud providers, hybrid scenarios

### How to Extend

1. **Copy existing app structure** as a template
2. **Customize CLAUDE.md** for your domain
3. **Add your specific tools** and configurations  
4. **Update root README.md** to include your app
5. **Share with the team!**

### Benefits of This Pattern
