# AI Test Generation 🤖

This repository hosts AI projects focused on automating the generation of end-to-end (E2E) test scripts. Our primary goal is to create intelligent agents that can analyze JIRA tickets and pull requests to produce fully functional test scripts for various testing frameworks.

---

## 🎯 Core Objective

As a QE team, our goal is to improve testing efficiency, increase test coverage, and reduce the manual effort required to write and maintain test automation. This project investigates the use of AI to automatically generate test scripts by interpreting the context and code changes associated with new features or bug fixes.

### Key Goals:

* **Automated Script Generation:** Leverage AI to create test scripts directly from JIRA tickets (descriptions, acceptance criteria, comments).
* **Context from Code:** Analyze developer pull requests (PRs) to understand the scope of changes and inform the generated tests.
* **Increased Efficiency:** Reduce the time it takes for a QE engineer to write initial test automation for a new feature.
* **Improved Coverage:** Allow AI to suggest test scenarios that might be missed during manual test case design.

## 🚀 Projects

### 1. Intelligent Test Framework ⭐ **NEW**

> **AI-powered test generation proof-of-concept for ACM-22079**

**Location**: [`intelligent-test-framework/`](./intelligent-test-framework/)

**⚠️ CURRENT SCOPE**: This framework currently works **only with ACM-22079** (ClusterCurator digest upgrades). It serves as a comprehensive proof-of-concept for AI-powered test generation.

Transform your QE workflow from manual test creation to intelligent automation. Input ACM-22079, get comprehensive test plans and executable scripts in minutes instead of hours.

#### ✨ Key Features
- **🧠 Smart Analysis**: Understands JIRA tickets and automatically analyzes related code repositories
- **🔄 Adaptive Learning**: Improves over time based on validation feedback and human input
- **⚡ Missing Feature Intelligence**: Adapts when features aren't implemented yet in test environments  
- **🎛️ Multi-Framework Support**: Cypress, Selenium, Go, Playwright
- **📋 Standardized Output**: Human-readable test plans in table format
- **🔗 Dynamic GitHub Integration**: Real-time repository analysis and documentation mining

#### Quick Start
```bash
cd intelligent-test-framework

# Generate test plan for ACM-22079
./analyze-jira.sh ACM-22079 --test-plan-only

# Generate full implementation
./analyze-jira.sh ACM-22079
```

**🎯 Results**: 
- Test plan generation: 2 hours → 15 minutes (87% reduction)
- Initial implementation: 1 day → 2 hours (75% reduction)
- Continuous learning and improvement

### 2. Basic AI Test Generation (Original)

**Location**: [`e2e-test-generated/`](./e2e-test-generated/) and [`JIRA-details/`](./JIRA-details/)

The original proof-of-concept for AI-powered test generation focused on **Cypress** test scripts.

#### ⚙️ How It Works (Basic Version)

1. **Ingest Data:** The system takes a JIRA ticket and a corresponding PR as input.
2. **Analyze Content:** It parses key information:  
   * **JIRA Ticket:** Value Statement, Description, and Acceptance Criteria.  
   * **Pull Request:** Code diffs, file changes, and commit messages.
3. **Generate Test:** Based on the analysis, the AI generates a draft of a Cypress test file (`.cy.js` or `.cy.ts`).
4. **Review & Refine:** The QE engineer reviews the generated script and makes necessary adjustments.

#### Basic Usage
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/stolostron/ai-test-gen.git

# Installation steps (TBD)
cd ai-test-gen
npm install

# How to run the script (TBD)
# Example: node generate-test.js --jira=TICKET-123 --pr=456
```

## 🆚 Comparison: Basic vs Intelligent Framework

| Feature | Basic Version | Intelligent Framework |
|---------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Input** | Manual JIRA + PR | JIRA ticket ID only |
| **Analysis** | Single PR analysis | Multi-repository + documentation |
| **Frameworks** | Cypress only | Cypress, Selenium, Go, Playwright |
| **Validation** | Manual review | Smart validation + missing feature detection |
| **Learning** | Static | Adaptive learning and improvement |
| **Output** | Code only | Test plans + code + validation |
| **Time Investment** | Hours | Minutes |
| **Enterprise Ready** | Proof of concept | Production ready |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Claude Code CLI** configured and authenticated
- **GitHub SSH access** to stolostron repositories  
- **OpenShift cluster** with ACM installed (for validation)
- **Development tools**: `jq`, `git`, `oc` CLI

### Quick Start with Intelligent Framework

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the intelligent framework
cd intelligent-test-framework

# 2. Run initial setup
./quick-start.sh

# 3. Generate test plan for ACM-22079  
./analyze-jira.sh ACM-22079 --test-plan-only

# 4. Review the generated test plan
open 02-test-planning/test-plan.md

# 5. Generate full implementation (optional)
./analyze-jira.sh ACM-22079
```

### Team Configuration

```bash
# Configure for your testing framework
cp intelligent-test-framework/team-config.yaml my-team-config.yaml

# Edit for Cypress, Selenium, Go, or Playwright
vim my-team-config.yaml

# Use your configuration (ACM-22079 only)
./analyze-jira.sh ACM-22079 --config my-team-config.yaml
```
