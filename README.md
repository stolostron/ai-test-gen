# AI Systems Suite

> **Enterprise multi-app Claude configuration with complete isolation architecture**

A modular enterprise automation suite featuring completely isolated AI applications for QE teams. Each app operates independently with zero cross-contamination, enabling infinite scalability and team ownership.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Claude Code CLI** configured and authenticated
- **JIRA access** (jira api) for ticket analysis (test generator) - See `shared/docs/JIRA_API_SETUP.md`
- **kubectl/oc** for cluster operations and real environment data collection

### 2-Step Setup
1. **Clone the repo** 
2. **Ask Claude** by - 

### Method 1: Just say for it!
```bash
# Just speak naturally - AI router understands and routes automatically:
"Generate test plan for ACM-22079"
"Debug the Jenkins pipeline failure"
"I need to validate the new cluster management feature"
"Help me analyze this automation issue"
```

### Method 2: Direct Navigation
```bash
# Direct app navigation:
cd apps/claude-test-generator/
"Generate test plan for ACM-22079"
"Analyze PR: https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123"

cd apps/z-stream-analysis/  
"Analyze https://jenkins-url/job/pipeline/123/"
"Investigate clc-e2e-pipeline-3313"
```

**Both methods are 100% equivalent** - Smart Proxy Router with AI-powered intent detection provides transparent context injection with identical results.

## 🏗️ Isolation Architecture

**Complete App Independence:** Achieved through enterprise-grade isolation design:

### Core Principles
- **Zero Context Contamination**: Claude never mixes up which app you're using
- **Complete Self-Containment**: Each app works without knowledge of others
- **Prefixed AI Services**: `tg_` (test-generator) and `za_` (z-stream-analysis) namespacing
- **Independent Configurations**: 124-line global config vs. previous 2,700+ line monolith

### App Structure
```
apps/your-app/
├── .app-config              # App identity and isolation rules
├── CLAUDE.md               # Self-contained configuration with isolation headers
├── .claude/                # App-specific AI services (prefixed)
├── runs/                   # Independent results storage
└── docs/                   # App-specific documentation
```

### Benefits
- **Team Ownership**: Different teams can own different apps without conflicts
- **Parallel Development**: Work on apps simultaneously without interference  
- **Easy Extension**: Add unlimited apps following standard patterns
- **Maintenance Safety**: Update one app without affecting others

## 🔧 Adding New Applications

Follow the proven isolation pattern:

1. **Create App Directory**: `apps/your-app-name/`
2. **Add App Config**: `.app-config` with unique name and AI service prefix
3. **Create Isolated CLAUDE.md**: Include isolation headers and self-contained logic
4. **Implement AI Services**: Use unique prefix for all service files
5. **Verify Isolation**: Test independence using verification guidelines
6. **Update Global**: Add basic app description to this file

**Template Available**: `shared/templates/app-extension-guide.md` provides complete step-by-step instructions
