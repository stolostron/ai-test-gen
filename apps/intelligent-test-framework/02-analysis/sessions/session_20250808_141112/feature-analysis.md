This comprehensive analysis demonstrates deep understanding of ACM-22079's digest upgrade functionality based on actual implementation code (`hive.go:293-833`), existing test patterns from `clc-ui-e2e`, and ClusterCurator architecture. The test strategy covers all major scenarios including the three-tier digest resolution, error handling, RBAC, and production deployment considerations while aligning with ACM's existing test automation patterns.
