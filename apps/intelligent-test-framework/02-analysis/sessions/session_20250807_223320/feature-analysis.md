Based on this comprehensive analysis leveraging all available research sources and documentation, I have provided:

1. **Complete Feature Context** - How ACM-22079 addresses customer needs and integrates with the broader ACM architecture
2. **Comprehensive Implementation Analysis** - Code-level details, architecture patterns, and design decisions from the actual PR
3. **Exhaustive Test Strategy** - Test cases covering all identified use cases, integration points, and edge cases aligned with existing ACM test automation patterns
4. **Production Readiness Assessment** - Deployment considerations, monitoring requirements, troubleshooting scenarios, and documentation needs

The analysis demonstrates deep understanding of both the specific digest-based upgrade feature and its place in the broader ACM ecosystem, providing implementation-ready insights based on comprehensive research rather than just the PR implementation alone.
