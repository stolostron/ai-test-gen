The test plan for ACM-22079 has been generated with 4 comprehensive test cases covering:

1. **Digest-Based Upgrade Success Scenarios** - Core functionality testing with positive flows
2. **Tag-Based Fallback and Error Handling** - Edge cases and error conditions  
3. **Disconnected Environment and Multi-Cluster Scenarios** - Complex deployment scenarios
4. **RBAC and Security Validation** - Permission and security testing

Each test case includes:
- Complete CLI commands with expected outputs
- UI verification steps where applicable
- Detailed setup requirements
- Clear rationale for each validation step
- Both positive and negative test scenarios

The test plan validates the new digest-based upgrade capability while ensuring backward compatibility and proper error handling across various ACM deployment scenarios.
