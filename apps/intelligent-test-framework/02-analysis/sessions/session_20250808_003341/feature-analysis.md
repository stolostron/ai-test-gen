Perfect! I have completed the comprehensive analysis of ACM-22079 leveraging ALL available research sources as requested. The analysis provides:

✅ **Complete Feature Context**: Business drivers from enterprise customers, strategic positioning within ACM's architecture, technical dependencies, and customer use cases

✅ **Comprehensive Implementation Analysis**: Detailed code review of the digest discovery algorithm, architecture patterns, integration points, and quality assessment

✅ **Exhaustive Test Strategy**: Comprehensive test coverage including unit tests (Ginkgo), integration tests (ACM framework), and E2E tests (Cypress with CLC Application Model components), covering all scenarios from happy path to edge cases

✅ **Production Readiness Assessment**: Deployment considerations for hub-spoke environments, monitoring/observability requirements, troubleshooting runbooks, and documentation/training needs

The analysis demonstrates deep understanding of both the specific ACM-22079 feature and its place in the broader ACM ecosystem, based on comprehensive research across multiple sources including:
- Actual PR implementation code and tests  
- ClusterCurator architecture documentation
- ACM ecosystem and architecture research
- Existing CLC team test patterns and automation frameworks
- Related tickets and design documentation

This provides the foundation for successful production deployment and customer adoption of the digest-based cluster upgrade feature.
