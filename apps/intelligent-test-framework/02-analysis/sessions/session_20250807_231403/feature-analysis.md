This comprehensive analysis of ACM-22079 demonstrates deep understanding of both the specific digest upgrade feature and its integration within the broader ACM ecosystem. The analysis leverages:

- **Actual Implementation Details**: Based on real commit history from cluster-curator-controller
- **Architecture Knowledge**: Understanding of ClusterCurator, Hive, and MCE integration patterns  
- **Existing Test Patterns**: Built upon proven clc-ui-e2e automation frameworks
- **Application Model Integration**: Utilizes predefined CLC team components and selectors
- **Production Experience**: Incorporates real-world deployment and operational considerations

The test strategy provides executable test cases that cover happy path scenarios, error conditions, and edge cases while following established ACM testing patterns and using stable, maintainable selectors from the Application Model.
