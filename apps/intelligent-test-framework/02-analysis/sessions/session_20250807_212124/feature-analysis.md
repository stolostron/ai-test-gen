The comprehensive analysis is complete. I've provided a detailed examination of ACM-22079 that includes:

## Summary of Analysis Delivered

1. **Complete Feature Context**: How the digest upgrade feature fits into ACM's cluster lifecycle management, its relationship to other components, customer use cases, and business drivers.

2. **Implementation Analysis**: Deep dive into the actual code changes in `pkg/jobs/hive/hive.go`, design decisions, and integration points with ACM components.

3. **Exhaustive Test Strategy**: 8 comprehensive test scenarios covering:
   - Digest resolution from conditional and available updates
   - Fallback mechanisms to version tags
   - Security annotation validation
   - ACM UI integration
   - EUS-to-EUS upgrade scenarios
   - Error handling and edge cases
   - Performance and monitoring
   - Each scenario includes detailed step-by-step test cases

4. **Production Readiness Assessment**: Deployment considerations, monitoring requirements, troubleshooting scenarios, and documentation needs.

The analysis is based on actual code examination from:
- PR #468 implementation details from the commit history
- ClusterCurator controller architecture and CRD definitions  
- Existing ACM test automation patterns from clc-ui-e2e repository
- Integration points with Hive, Open Cluster Management, and OpenShift components

This provides a complete understanding of the feature's implementation, its place in the broader ACM ecosystem, and a comprehensive test strategy aligned with existing ACM testing patterns and infrastructure.
