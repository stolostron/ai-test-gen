I need to see the test plan content before I can generate the Cypress implementation. You mentioned "Based on the approved test plan" but I don't see the actual test plan in your message.

Could you please provide:

1. The test plan content (the markdown table with steps and expected results)
2. The feature name or JIRA ID this relates to
3. Any specific requirements or constraints for the Cypress implementation

Once you share the test plan, I'll generate the complete Cypress test implementation including all the components you requested.
