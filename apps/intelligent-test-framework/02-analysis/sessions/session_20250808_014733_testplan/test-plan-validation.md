I need to see the test plan you'd like me to improve. Could you please provide the test plan content that needs validation and improvement?

Once you share the test plan, I'll review it and provide an improved version that:

- Maintains the exact `| Test Steps | Expected Results |` table format
- Improves test step completeness and clarity
- Ensures command accuracy and specificity
- Enhances expected results precision
- Adds better edge case coverage
- Validates environment considerations

Please paste the test plan content you'd like me to review.
