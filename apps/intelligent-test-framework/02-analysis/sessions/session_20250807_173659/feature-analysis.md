## **Summary**

I have completed a comprehensive analysis of ACM-22079 leveraging all available research and documentation. This analysis provides:

### **Key Deliverables:**

1. **Complete Feature Context**: Deep understanding of how digest upgrades fit into ACM's cluster lifecycle management ecosystem, addressing enterprise security, air-gapped environments, and compliance requirements.

2. **Comprehensive Implementation Analysis**: Technical details showing how ACM-22079 extends the existing ClusterCurator controller architecture, with specific code references and integration patterns.

3. **Exhaustive Test Strategy**: Multi-dimensional test coverage including format validation, cross-platform compatibility, error handling, UI automation, and performance testing, all aligned with existing CLC test patterns.

4. **Production Readiness Assessment**: Detailed deployment considerations, monitoring requirements, troubleshooting procedures, and documentation needs for enterprise environments.

### **Key Insights:**

- **Architecture Integration**: ACM-22079 seamlessly extends the existing ClusterCurator upgrade workflow by enhancing the `UpgradeHooks` specification to support digest references alongside traditional version tags.

- **Security Enhancement**: Provides cryptographically verifiable upgrade paths crucial for enterprise environments requiring immutable image references.

- **Test Pattern Alignment**: Leverages existing CLC UI E2E test infrastructure and extends it with digest-specific validation, building on proven automation patterns.

- **Enterprise Readiness**: Addresses critical requirements for air-gapped deployments, compliance auditing, and supply chain security.

This analysis demonstrates that ACM-22079 represents a significant advancement in ACM's capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility and leveraging the robust existing infrastructure. The comprehensive test strategy ensures thorough validation across all supported cluster types and deployment scenarios.
