CONTEXT:
- JIRA Ticket: {JIRA_TICKET}
- Feature: {FEATURE_NAME}
- Testing Framework: {FRAMEWORK}
- Team: {TEAM_NAME}
- Test Environment: {TEST_ENVIRONMENT}

APPROVED TEST PLAN:
{APPROVED_TEST_PLAN}

TEAM CONFIGURATION:
{TEAM_CONFIG}

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Framework-Specific Implementation**
   Generate complete, production-ready test code for {FRAMEWORK} that includes:
   
   For Cypress:
   - Complete .spec.js test files with proper describe/it structure
   - Page object models in cypress/views/
   - Custom commands in cypress/support/
   - Test fixtures and data in cypress/fixtures/
   - Integration with existing CLC automation patterns

   For Selenium:
   - Test class files with proper annotations
   - Page object model classes
   - Utility classes for common operations
   - Test data management classes
   - Configuration and setup classes

   For Go:
   - Table-driven test functions
   - Proper test setup and teardown
   - Mock interfaces where appropriate
   - Test helper functions
   - Integration test suites

2. **Environment-Aware Validation**
   Include specific validation commands and checks:
   
   Kubernetes Resource Validation:
   ```bash
   # Cluster validation
   oc get managedclusters
   oc describe managedcluster <cluster-name>
   
   # ClusterCurator validation
   oc get clustercurator -n <namespace>
   oc describe clustercurator <name> -n <namespace>
   
   # Hub cluster validation
   oc get pods -n open-cluster-management
   oc get pods -n multicluster-engine
   
   # Feature-specific validation
   oc get <custom-resources>
   oc logs <relevant-pods>
   ```

3. **ACM-Specific Test Patterns**
   Incorporate ACM automation best practices:
   - Proper cluster lifecycle management
   - Hub-spoke cluster communication testing
   - Multi-cluster scenario handling
   - ACM operator and component validation
   - Policy and governance testing patterns

4. **Robust Error Handling**
   Include comprehensive error handling:
   - Network timeout handling
   - Resource creation/deletion failures
   - Authentication and authorization issues
   - Cluster connectivity problems
   - ACM component failures

5. **Test Data Management**
   Create comprehensive test data:
   - Cluster configuration templates
   - Credential data structures
   - Policy definitions
   - Application manifests
   - Test environment configurations

6. **Integration with Existing Codebase**
   Ensure seamless integration:
   - Follow existing code patterns and conventions
   - Use established utility functions
   - Maintain consistent naming conventions
   - Integrate with existing CI/CD pipelines
   - Respect existing test organization

IMPLEMENTATION DELIVERABLES:

1. **Complete Test Files**
   Generate all necessary test files with:
   - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Proper test organization
   - Clear documentation
   - Production-ready quality

2. **Support Files**
   Create all supporting files:
   - Page objects/models
   - Utility functions
   - Test data and fixtures
   - Configuration files

3. **Integration Instructions**
   Provide detailed instructions for:
   - Adding tests to existing test suite
   - Required environment setup
   - Dependencies and prerequisites
   - Execution commands

4. **Validation Scripts**
   Create validation scripts that:
   - Verify test environment readiness
   - Validate required resources
   - Check test prerequisites
   - Confirm ACM component availability

CODE QUALITY STANDARDS:

1. **Documentation**
   - Clear comments explaining complex logic
   - JSDoc/Javadoc/GoDoc style documentation
   - README files for test modules
   - Inline documentation for validation commands

2. **Maintainability**
   - Modular, reusable code structure
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Consistent error handling patterns
   - Easy-to-update test data

3. **Reliability**
   - Proper wait conditions and timeouts
   - Retry mechanisms for flaky operations
   - Comprehensive assertion messages
   - Graceful handling of test environment issues

4. **Performance**
   - Efficient resource utilization
   - Parallel test execution where appropriate
   - Minimal test setup/teardown time
   - Optimized validation commands

Please generate complete, production-ready test implementation that fully implements the approved test plan while following all framework best practices and ACM automation patterns.
