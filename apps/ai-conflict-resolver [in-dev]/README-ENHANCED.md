# AI Code Review & Conflict Resolution Assistant

An intelligent dual-purpose system that provides comprehensive PR code reviews AND automatic merge conflict resolution, powered by Claude AI. This enhanced version understands your codebase, testing patterns, and team standards to provide actionable improvement suggestions alongside conflict resolution.

## 🚀 Enhanced Features

### Intelligent Code Review
- **Deep Implementation Analysis**: Understands code logic, architecture, and intent
- **Test Coverage Assessment**: Identifies missing tests and suggests scenarios
- **Security Vulnerability Detection**: Scans for common security issues
- **Performance Analysis**: Identifies bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- **Code Quality Metrics**: Complexity, duplication, maintainability scoring
- **Best Practice Enforcement**: Ensures team coding standards

### Smart Conflict Resolution
- **Semantic Understanding**: Resolves conflicts based on code meaning
- **Context-Aware**: Uses JIRA tickets and PR history
- **Safety Checks**: Validates resolutions with tests
- **Rollback Capability**: Easy reversion if needed

### Unified Intelligence
- **Single System**: Both review and conflict resolution in one
- **Shared Context**: Leverages same JIRA/GitHub understanding
- **Consistent Standards**: Applies team patterns uniformly
- **Learning System**: Improves from feedback over time

## 📈 Health Score System

The system calculates an overall health score (0-100) based on:

```yaml
Health Score Components:
- Code Quality: 25%
- Test Coverage: 25%
- Security: 20%
- Performance: 15%
- Documentation: 15%

Score Ranges:
- 90-100: 🌟 Excellent - Ready to merge
- 75-89: ✅ Good - Minor improvements suggested
- 60-74: ⚠️ Needs Improvement - Address suggestions
- Below 60: ❌ Poor - Significant issues to resolve
```

## 💬 Interactive Commands

The system responds to PR comments with these commands:

```bash
# Comprehensive review
/review

# Focused reviews
/review security       # Security-focused analysis
/review performance    # Performance deep-dive
/review tests         # Test coverage analysis

# Get suggestions
/suggest improvements  # Additional improvement ideas
/suggest tests        # Test case suggestions

# Conflict resolution
/resolve-conflicts    # Auto-resolve conflicts
/resolve-conflicts --force  # Lower confidence threshold

# Help
/review help         # Show all commands

   - File: `src/api/clusterValidator.js`
   - Issue: No timeout handling in API calls
   - Suggestion: Add timeout and retry logic
   ```javascript
   // Current
   const response = await fetch(url);
   
   // Suggested
   const response = await fetch(url, {
     timeout: 5000,
     retry: { retries: 3 }
   });
   ```

2. **[MEDIUM]** Missing test for empty cluster scenario
   - File: `tests/clusterValidator.test.js`
   - Issue: No test covers empty cluster list
   - Suggestion: Add test case for edge scenario
