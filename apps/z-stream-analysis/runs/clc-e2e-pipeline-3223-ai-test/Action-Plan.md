# Action Plan: CLC E2E Pipeline #3223 Remediation

**Pipeline:** clc-e2e-pipeline-3223-ai-test  
**Issue:** URL pattern mismatch in AKS cluster import test  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Total Resolution Time:** 1-2 days  

## Immediate Actions (0-24 hours)

| Priority | Action | Owner | Timeline | Success Criteria |
|----------|--------|-------|----------|------------------|
| Critical | Update URL assertion pattern in managedCluster.js line 1158 | QE Team | 2 hours | Test assertion updated to expect `~managed-cluster` prefix |
| Critical | Local test validation with AKS import | QE Team | 1 hour | Updated test passes locally with AKS cluster import |
| Critical | Create pull request with fix | QE Team | 30 minutes | PR created with clear description of URL pattern fix |
| High | Emergency pipeline unblock if needed | QE Team | 1 hour | Pipeline can proceed with hotfix if critical |

**Immediate Fix Details:**
```javascript
// File: cypress/views/clusters/managedCluster.js:1158
// Change from:
.should('include', `/multicloud/infrastructure/clusters/details/${clusterName}/${clusterName}/overview`)
// To:
.should('include', `/multicloud/infrastructure/clusters/details/~managed-cluster/${clusterName}/overview`)
```

## Short-term Actions (1-7 days)

| Priority | Action | Owner | Timeline | Success Criteria |
|----------|--------|-------|----------|------------------|
| High | Comprehensive cluster type testing | QE Team | 1 day | AKS, ROSA, GCP cluster imports all pass with new pattern |
| High | Cross-browser validation | QE Team | 4 hours | Fix works in Chrome, Firefox, Edge test environments |
| High | Pipeline integration testing | QE Team | 2 hours | Post-upgrade pipeline completes successfully |
| Medium | Test documentation update | QE Team | 2 days | Documentation reflects current URL routing structure |
| Medium | Review similar URL patterns in test suite | QE Team | 1 day | Identify other tests potentially affected by routing changes |
| Medium | Code review and merge | QE Team | 1 day | Changes reviewed, approved, and merged to main branch |

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] AKS cluster import via kubeconfig works
- [ ] AKS cluster import via API token works  
- [ ] ROSA cluster import via kubeconfig works
- [ ] ROSA cluster import via API token works
- [ ] GCP cluster import works
- [ ] Cluster details page navigation functions correctly
- [ ] No regression in other cluster management tests

## Long-term Actions (1-4 weeks)

| Priority | Action | Owner | Timeline | Success Criteria |
|----------|--------|-------|----------|------------------|
| Medium | Implement flexible URL matching utility | QE Team | 2 weeks | Reusable URL pattern matching functions available |
| Medium | Create URL pattern configuration system | QE Team | 2 weeks | Centralized configuration for different routing patterns |
| Medium | Add automated URL pattern validation | QE Team | 3 weeks | CI checks detect URL pattern inconsistencies |
| Low | Enhance test resilience framework | QE Team | 4 weeks | Tests more resistant to UI routing changes |
| Low | Performance optimization review | QE Team | 2 weeks | Ensure URL matching optimizations don't impact test speed |

**Enhanced URL Matching Implementation:**
```javascript
// Proposed utility function
const urlPatterns = {
  clusterDetails: [
    '/multicloud/infrastructure/clusters/details/~managed-cluster/{clusterName}/overview',
    '/multicloud/infrastructure/clusters/details/{clusterName}/{clusterName}/overview' // fallback
  ]
};

function validateClusterUrl(clusterName) {
  return cy.url().should('match', new RegExp(
    urlPatterns.clusterDetails[0].replace('{clusterName}', clusterName)
  ));
}
```

## Monitoring & Validation

**Continuous Monitoring:**
- Monitor post-upgrade pipeline success rate
- Track cluster import test execution times
- Watch for similar URL pattern failures in other tests
- Monitor console routing changes that might affect test patterns

**Quality Gates:**
- All cluster import tests must pass before deployment
- No increase in test execution time due to URL pattern changes
- Documentation must be updated before production deployment

**Alert Conditions:**
- Any cluster import test failures
- Unusual increases in test execution time
- Console routing changes detected by automated monitoring

## Dependencies & Blockers

**Dependencies:**
- **Console Routing Stability:** Changes depend on stable console routing patterns
- **Test Environment Access:** Requires access to dev09.red-chesterfield.com environment
- **QE Team Availability:** Primary and secondary QE team members for validation

**Potential Blockers:**
- **Environment Issues:** Test environment instability could delay validation
- **Console Changes:** Additional console routing changes during fix implementation
- **Resource Constraints:** Limited QE capacity for comprehensive testing

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Backup Environment:** Use alternative test environments if primary unavailable
- **Staged Rollout:** Implement fix incrementally across test suites
- **Parallel Testing:** Use multiple team members for faster validation
- **Emergency Rollback:** Prepare rollback plan if fix causes additional issues

## Risk Assessment & Contingency

**Implementation Risks:**
- **Low Risk:** Single line code change with clear pattern
- **Medium Risk:** Potential impact on other cluster import tests
- **Low Risk:** Performance impact from URL pattern matching

**Contingency Plans:**
- **Rollback Strategy:** Immediate revert capability if fix causes regressions
- **Alternative Approaches:** Regex-based URL matching as backup solution
- **Emergency Bypass:** Temporary test skip option for critical pipeline needs

**Quality Assurance:**
- **Peer Review:** All changes reviewed by secondary QE team member
- **Automated Testing:** Changes validated by existing test automation
- **Manual Verification:** Manual cluster import testing for critical scenarios

## Communication Plan

**Stakeholder Updates:**
- **QE Team:** Immediate notification of fix implementation and validation results
- **Release Team:** Update on pipeline unblock and testing status
- **Development Team:** Notification of console routing dependency

**Status Reporting:**
- **Hourly Updates:** During immediate action phase (0-24 hours)
- **Daily Updates:** During short-term action phase (1-7 days)  
- **Weekly Updates:** During long-term improvement phase

**Next Review:** Tomorrow at 9:00 AM  
**Escalation Path:** If fix doesn't resolve issue within 24 hours, escalate to Senior QE Lead and Development Team  
**Success Metrics:** Pipeline resumes normal operation, no test regressions, improved URL pattern resilience implemented
