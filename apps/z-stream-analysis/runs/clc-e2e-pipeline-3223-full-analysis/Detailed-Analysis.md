## Failure Analysis

### Primary Failure
**Test Case:** RHACM4K-4054 - CLC Import - Verify that user can import AKS cluster with latest k8s version by kubeconfig

**Error Details:**
```
AssertionError: Timed out retrying after 30000ms: 
expected 'https://console-openshift-console.apps.cqu-m275-yup.dev09.red-chesterfield.com/multicloud/infrastructure/clusters/details/~managed-cluster/clc-aks-417-3nw3y-aks-kubeconfig/overview' 
to include '/multicloud/infrastructure/clusters/details/clc-aks-417-3nw3y-aks-kubeconfig/clc-aks-417-3nw3y-aks-kubeconfig/overview'
```

**Location:** `cypress/views/clusters/managedCluster.js:1158:11`

### Root Cause Analysis

#### 1. URL Pattern Mismatch
The test failure indicates a discrepancy between expected and actual URL patterns during AKS cluster import validation:

**Expected URL Pattern:**
```
/multicloud/infrastructure/clusters/details/clc-aks-417-3nw3y-aks-kubeconfig/clc-aks-417-3nw3y-aks-kubeconfig/overview
```

**Actual URL Pattern:**
```
/multicloud/infrastructure/clusters/details/~managed-cluster/clc-aks-417-3nw3y-aks-kubeconfig/overview
```

**Key Differences:**
- Actual URL contains `~managed-cluster` segment
- Expected URL duplicates the cluster name in the path
- This suggests a change in the console routing logic or cluster naming convention

#### 2. Technical Investigation Points

**A. Console Routing Changes**
- The presence of `~managed-cluster` indicates potential changes to OpenShift Console dynamic plugin routing
- This could be related to ACM 2.12 console integration updates
- May affect URL generation in cluster import workflows

**B. Cluster Naming Logic**
- The cluster name `clc-aks-417-3nw3y-aks-kubeconfig` follows expected pattern
- But URL structure doesn't match test expectations
- Indicates possible changes in how cluster details URLs are constructed

**C. Test Environment State**
- Console successfully loaded: "Static plugins" and "Dynamic plugins" detected
- MCE plugin loaded correctly: `mce, monitoring-plugin`
- Authentication successful: kubeadmin user logged in
- Base functionality intact: cluster list page accessible

### Timeline Analysis

**Pre-Failure State (Working):**
- Docker container setup: ✅ Success
- NPM dependencies: ✅ Installed (with warnings about deprecated packages)
- Cypress initialization: ✅ Complete
- Authentication: ✅ User logged in successfully
- Navigation: ✅ Reached cluster management interface

**Failure Point:**
- Import process initiated successfully
- Cluster import appeared to proceed
- URL validation failed at verification step
- Timeout occurred after 30 seconds of retry attempts

**Post-Failure Recovery:**
- Other test cases marked as pending (not executed due to failure)
- Artifacts saved: screenshots, videos, test reports
- Pipeline marked as UNSTABLE (not FAILURE)

### Infrastructure Assessment

#### Environment Health
- **Jenkins Agent:** acmqe-automation10 - Operating normally
- **Docker Container:** quay.io/stolostron/acm-qe:centos9-nodejs22 - Functional
- **Network Connectivity:** All API calls successful
- **Authentication:** All credential validations passed
- **Resource Availability:** No timeout or resource constraints detected

#### Dependencies Status
- **OpenShift Console:** Responsive and accessible
- **MCE Plugin:** Loaded and functional
- **Hub Cluster API:** Accessible and responding
- **Azure Integration:** Cluster kubeconfig available and processed

## Pattern Recognition

### Historical Context
This type of URL pattern mismatch typically indicates:
1. **Console Plugin Updates** - Changes to dynamic plugin routing
2. **ACM Version Migration** - URL structure changes between versions
3. **Test Maintenance Needs** - Test expectations not updated with product changes

### Similar Failure Indicators
- No other tests in this run exhibited similar URL validation issues
- Isolated to AKS import functionality
- Pattern suggests product change rather than environmental issue

## Error Classification

**Category:** Test Maintenance / Product Change Validation  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Type:** Regression or Test Drift  
**Scope:** Limited to AKS cluster import URL validation  

## Remediation Strategy

### Immediate Actions (0-24 hours)
1. **Validate Current Product Behavior**
   ```bash
   # Manual validation steps
   1. Access: https://console-openshift-console.apps.cqu-m275-yup.dev09.red-chesterfield.com/multicloud/infrastructure/clusters/managed
   2. Import AKS cluster via kubeconfig method
   3. Document actual URL patterns during import process
   4. Compare with test expectations
   ```

2. **Code Review Analysis**
   - Review recent commits to release-2.12 affecting cluster import UI
   - Check console plugin changes in ACM 2.12
   - Validate URL routing logic in MCE console components

3. **Test Case Validation**
   - Run single test case manually with debug output
   - Capture actual vs expected URL patterns
   - Determine if test expectations need updating

### Short-term Actions (24-72 hours)
1. **Update Test Expectations** (if product behavior is correct)
   - Modify `managedCluster.js:1158` to handle new URL pattern
   - Update URL validation logic to accommodate `~managed-cluster` segment
   - Add flexible URL pattern matching for future robustness

2. **Product Validation** (if test expectations are correct)
   - File product issue for URL routing regression
   - Investigate console plugin configuration
   - Validate cluster import functionality across different cloud providers

3. **Test Framework Enhancement**
   - Add URL pattern logging for better debugging
   - Implement more flexible URL validation
   - Add retry logic with different URL patterns

### Long-term Improvements (1-2 weeks)
1. **Monitoring Enhancement**
   - Add URL pattern validation to daily monitoring
   - Implement alerts for unexpected URL structure changes
   - Create automated validation for console routing consistency

2. **Test Robustness**
   - Make URL validation more resilient to minor pattern changes
   - Add configuration-driven URL pattern expectations
   - Implement progressive validation with fallback patterns

## Technical Recommendations

### Code Changes Required
```javascript
// Current failing assertion (line 1158 in managedCluster.js)
cy.url().should('include', expectedUrlPattern)

// Recommended flexible approach
cy.url().should('satisfy', (url) => {
  return url.includes('/multicloud/infrastructure/clusters/details/') &&
         url.includes(clusterName) &&
         url.includes('/overview')
})
```

### Configuration Updates
- Update test configuration to handle console plugin routing variations
- Add environment-specific URL pattern configurations
- Implement runtime URL pattern detection

### Monitoring Additions
- Add console routing health checks to pipeline pre-conditions
- Monitor URL pattern consistency across test environments
- Alert on unexpected console plugin behavior

## Prevention Measures

1. **Change Detection**
   - Add console URL pattern validation to pre-commit hooks
   - Monitor ACM console plugin changes for routing impacts
   - Implement automated URL pattern baseline updates

2. **Test Maintenance**
   - Regular review of URL validation logic in test cases
   - Automated detection of product UI changes affecting tests
   - Version-aware test configuration management

3. **Communication**
   - Establish change notification process for console routing updates
   - Include test team in console plugin review process
   - Document URL pattern expectations in test documentation

## Conclusion

This failure represents a straightforward test maintenance issue caused by a URL pattern mismatch during AKS cluster import validation. The underlying import functionality appears to work correctly, but test expectations need alignment with current product behavior.

The issue is contained to a single test case with no broader infrastructure or functional concerns. Resolution requires validation of current product behavior and updating test expectations accordingly.

**Priority:** High - affects release validation  
**Complexity:** Low - isolated test maintenance  
**Risk:** Low - no functional regression indicated  

The pipeline can be re-run immediately after test case correction, and normal release validation should proceed without further issues.
