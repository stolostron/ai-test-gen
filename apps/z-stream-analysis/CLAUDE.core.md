## 📋 DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: All documentation must follow first-time reader principles:
- ❌ **BLOCKED**: Marketing terms like "Enhanced", "Advanced", "Revolutionary", "Cutting-edge", "Next-generation", "Innovative", "State-of-the-art", "Premium", "Elite", "Ultimate", "Superior"
- ❌ **BLOCKED**: References to "before" and "after" versions or improvements  
- ❌ **BLOCKED**: Promotional language or version comparison content
- ✅ **REQUIRED**: Clear, direct language for readers with no prior system knowledge
- ✅ **REQUIRED**: Evidence-based technical claims with verified citations
- ✅ **REQUIRED**: Definitive classification (PRODUCT BUG | AUTOMATION BUG) with confidence assessment
