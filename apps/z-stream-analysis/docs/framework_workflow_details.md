## üèóÔ∏è **Core Architecture: 2-Agent + AI Services**

### **üéØ 2-Agent Framework Design**

Unlike traditional sequential analysis or over-engineered multi-agent systems, Z-Stream uses an optimal **2-agent architecture** specifically designed for pipeline failure analysis workflow:

**üîç Investigation Intelligence Agent (Agent A)**
- **Specialization**: Comprehensive evidence gathering and validation
- **Focus**: Jenkins analysis, environment testing, repository examination
- **Output**: Complete evidence package with quality assessment

**üõ†Ô∏è Solution Intelligence Agent (Agent B)**
- **Specialization**: Analysis, classification, and solution generation
- **Focus**: Evidence analysis, PRODUCT/AUTOMATION BUG classification, fix generation
- **Input**: Complete investigation context via Progressive Context Architecture

### **üõ°Ô∏è Why 2 Agents Is Optimal**

**Decision Rationale:**
- **Natural Workflow**: Pipeline analysis follows investigate ‚Üí solve pattern
- **Evidence Building**: Progressive evidence accumulation matches analysis workflow
- **Specialization Benefits**: Expert focus without artificial separation
- **Optimal Complexity**: Sophisticated intelligence without over-engineering

**Compared to Alternatives:**
- **Single Agent**: Lacks specialization benefits and systematic coordination
- **3+ Agents**: Over-engineering for pipeline analysis workflow
- **Sequential Process**: Missing intelligent coordination and context inheritance

---

## üì° **Progressive Context Architecture**

### **üîÑ Systematic Intelligence Coordination**

**The Challenge:** Traditional approaches either lack coordination between analysis phases or create artificial complexity that doesn't match the natural workflow.

**The Solution:** Progressive Context Architecture implements systematic context inheritance from Investigation Intelligence to Solution Intelligence with intelligent validation and real-time monitoring.

cy.exec(`oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user ... | oc adm policy ...`);

// AFTER (sequential with error handling):
const cmd1 = `oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user ...`;
const cmd2 = `oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user admin ...`;

cy.exec(cmd1, { timeout: 90000, failOnNonZeroExit: false })
  .then((result1) => {
    cy.log(`First command result: ${result1.stdout}`);
