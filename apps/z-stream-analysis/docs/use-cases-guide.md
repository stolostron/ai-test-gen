### **Use Case 1: Flaky UI Test Investigation**

**Scenario:** Selenium test fails intermittently with "element not found" errors

**Input:**
```yaml
Jenkins_Pipeline: "https://jenkins-csb-rhacm-tests.dno.corp.redhat.com/job/CI-Jobs/job/e2e_ui_test_pipeline/520/"
Failed_Test: "test_create_cluster_ui"
Error_Pattern: "ElementNotFound: Unable to locate element: //button[@id='create-cluster']"
Frequency: "Fails 40% of the time"
Environment: "qe6-v1.lab.psi.redhat.com"
```

**AI Services Analysis Process:**

#### **Phase 1: Environment Validation**
```python
# Extracted from Jenkins parameters:
environment_context = {
    "cluster_url": "https://api.qe6-v1.lab.psi.redhat.com:6443",
    "namespace": "acm-test",
    "kubeconfig": "/tmp/kubeconfig-qe6"
}
