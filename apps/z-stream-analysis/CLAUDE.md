# Z-Stream Analysis Engine V3.1

> **Enterprise AI Services Integration with Environment Validation, Repository Analysis, and Merge-Ready Fix Generation**

## 🚨 MANDATORY DEFAULT BEHAVIOR

**CRITICAL:** When provided with ANY Jenkins URL or pipeline reference, automatically execute the complete Enterprise AI Services workflow including:

1. **Extract Jenkins Data**: Metadata, console logs, parameters via curl/WebFetch
2. **AI Branch Validation**: Parse console logs for git checkout commands, extract correct branch 
3. **Repository Cloning**: Clone automation repository using EXACT branch from pipeline
4. **Real Code Analysis**: Examine actual failing test files with precise line numbers
5. **Environment Validation**: Test cluster connectivity and product functionality (when possible)
6. **Cross-Service Evidence**: Correlate all findings for definitive verdict generation
7. **Fix Generation**: Create exact code changes with verified file paths and implementations
8. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Save complete analysis to runs/{pipeline-id}_{timestamp}/
9. **Automatic Cleanup**: Remove temporary repositories while preserving analysis results

**This comprehensive analysis is NOT optional - it executes automatically for ANY Jenkins URL.**

**CRITICAL:** Step 9 includes automatic cleanup that removes temporary repositories (temp-repos/) while preserving all analysis results in runs/ directory.

**ENHANCED CLEANUP FRAMEWORK:** The analysis engine now includes mandatory cleanup enforcement to prevent storage bloat and maintain a clean working environment. All temporary repositories are automatically removed while preserving complete analysis results.
