# Z-Stream Analysis Engine V4.0

> **Enterprise AI Services Integration for High Performance Pipeline Analysis**

## üö® MANDATORY DEFAULT BEHAVIOR

**CRITICAL:** When provided with ANY Jenkins URL or pipeline reference, automatically execute the complete Enterprise AI Services workflow including:

1. **AI Environment Validation**: Connect to test environments and validate cluster connectivity
2. **Extract Jenkins Data**: Metadata, console logs, parameters via curl/WebFetch
3. **AI Branch Validation**: Parse console logs for git checkout commands, extract correct branch 
4. **Repository Analysis**: Clone and analyze actual automation repositories for comprehensive code examination
5. **Environment Validation**: Test cluster connectivity and product functionality validation
6. **Cross-Service Evidence**: Correlate all findings for definitive verdict generation
7. **Fix Generation**: Create exact code changes with verified file paths and implementations
8. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Save complete analysis to runs/{pipeline-id}_{timestamp}/
9. **Cleanup Operations**: Remove temporary repositories while preserving analysis results

**This comprehensive analysis is NOT optional - it executes automatically for ANY Jenkins URL.**

**CRITICAL:** Step 9 includes automatic cleanup that removes temporary repositories (temp-repos/) while preserving all analysis results in runs/ directory.

**ENHANCED CLEANUP FRAMEWORK:** The analysis engine now includes mandatory cleanup enforcement to prevent storage bloat and maintain a clean working environment. All temporary repositories are automatically removed while preserving complete analysis results.

## üñ•Ô∏è MANDATORY TERMINAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

**CRITICAL:** When showing pipeline analysis results, MUST print on terminal output:

### Complete Analysis Package Information
```
Complete analysis package includes:

1. Detailed-Analysis.md - Full technical report (shown above)
2. jenkins-metadata.json - Jenkins build data and environment parameters  
3. analysis-metadata.json - Analysis execution metrics and quality tracking
```

### Definitive Bug Classification
**MANDATORY:** Clearly address on BOTH terminal output AND final report:
- **PRODUCT BUG** - If product functionality issues found
- **AUTOMATION BUG** - If test automation code issues found  
- **NO BUGS FOUND** - If analysis shows no issues
- **BOTH PRODUCT AND AUTOMATION BUGS** - If both types detected

**ENFORCEMENT:** These requirements are STRICTLY ENFORCED for all pipeline analysis results to ensure complete transparency and proper issue classification.

## üéØ Application Purpose
