## 🔧 Configuration & Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Claude Code CLI** configured and authenticated
- **Jenkins API Access** to target instances (optional - can analyze public URLs)  
- **Network Access** to Jenkins instances and artifact storage
- **Self-Contained Operation** - No external dependencies or script requirements

### Environment Configuration

**Method 1: Environment Variables (Recommended)**
```bash
# Jenkins configuration (optional)
export JENKINS_URL="https://jenkins-csb-rhacm-tests.dno.corp.redhat.com"
export JENKINS_USER="your-username"
export JENKINS_TOKEN="your-api-token"

# Analysis configuration  
export ANALYSIS_OUTPUT_DIR="./runs"
export ARCHIVE_RETENTION_DAYS="90"
export DEBUG_MODE="false"
```

**Method 2: Application Defaults**
- Application works without Jenkins authentication for public URLs
- Interactive prompts for credentials when needed
- Auto-detection of pipeline IDs from URLs
- Graceful degradation when artifacts are inaccessible

### Quick Setup Verification

```bash
# Navigate to application
cd apps/z-stream-analysis

# Verify clean structure
ls -la
tree . -L 2

# Check existing analysis examples
cat runs/clc-e2e-pipeline-3223/Executive-Summary.md
cat runs/clc-e2e-pipeline-3223/Detailed-Analysis.md

# Review framework documentation
cat scripts/README.md
cat templates/README.md

# Review AI workflows
ls .claude/workflows/

# Verify environment configuration (optional)
cat .env
```

### Claude-Powered Analysis Workflow

The framework prioritizes curl-based Jenkins data extraction for reliable analysis:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to application context
cd apps/z-stream-analysis

# 2. Framework automatically uses curl for Jenkins data extraction:
# - curl -k -s "${JENKINS_URL}/api/json" for build metadata
# - curl -k -s "${JENKINS_URL}/consoleText" for console logs  
# - curl -k -s "${JENKINS_URL}/artifacts/" for artifact access

# 3. Use Claude to analyze Jenkins URLs
# Example: "Analyze this Jenkins pipeline failure: https://jenkins-url/job/pipeline/123/"

# 4. Claude creates structured analysis in runs/ directory
# 5. Results follow the established Executive + Detailed format
# 6. AI workflows available in .claude/workflows/ for advanced features
```

### Jenkins Data Extraction Methods

**Primary Method (Preferred):**
```bash
# Build metadata
curl -k -s "https://jenkins-server/job/pipeline/123/api/json"

# Console output (full)
curl -k -s "https://jenkins-server/job/pipeline/123/consoleText"

# Console output (tail for failures)
curl -k -s "https://jenkins-server/job/pipeline/123/consoleText" | tail -200

# Specific data extraction
curl -k -s "https://jenkins-server/job/pipeline/123/api/json" | jq '.result, .duration, .timestamp'
```

**Fallback Methods:**
- WebFetch tool for when curl encounters certificate issues
- Direct API access with authentication for private instances
- Local artifact processing for downloaded build data

## 📊 Analysis Workflow

### Standard Workflow
1. **Input Processing**: Parse Jenkins URL or pipeline ID
2. **Data Collection**: Extract build logs, artifacts, and metadata using curl-first approach
   - Primary: `curl -k -s` for Jenkins API and console data
   - Fallback: WebFetch tool for certificate-protected instances
   - Metadata: Extract build status, duration, timestamps, parameters
3. **AI Analysis**: Apply Claude-based analysis for pattern recognition
4. **Classification**: Categorize failures by type and severity
5. **Report Generation**: Create executive and detailed reports
6. **Action Items**: Generate specific remediation recommendations
