**Fallback Configuration (Optional)**
```bash
# Only needed for private Jenkins instances when parameter extraction fails
export JENKINS_USER="your-username"
export JENKINS_TOKEN="your-api-token"

# Analysis configuration (optional)
export ANALYSIS_OUTPUT_DIR="./runs"
export ARCHIVE_RETENTION_DAYS="90"

```

### Jenkins Data Extraction Methods (V3.1)

**Primary Method - Intelligent Parameter Extraction:**
```bash
# Test environment parameters (actual test environment used)
curl -k -s "https://jenkins-server/job/pipeline/123/parameters/"

# Build metadata
curl -k -s "https://jenkins-server/job/pipeline/123/api/json"

# Console output (full)
curl -k -s "https://jenkins-server/job/pipeline/123/consoleText"

# Console output (tail for failures)
curl -k -s "https://jenkins-server/job/pipeline/123/consoleText" | tail -200

# Specific data extraction with environment context
curl -k -s "https://jenkins-server/job/pipeline/123/api/json" | jq '.result, .duration, .timestamp'
curl -k -s "https://jenkins-server/job/pipeline/123/parameters/" | jq '.parameter[] | {name, value}'
```

**Real-World Examples:**
```bash
# Extract environment from UI test pipeline
curl -k -s "https://jenkins-csb-rhacm-tests.dno.corp.redhat.com/job/CI-Jobs/job/e2e_ui_test_pipeline/520/parameters/"

# Extract environment from CLC E2E pipeline  
curl -k -s "https://jenkins-csb-rhacm-tests.dno.corp.redhat.com/job/qe-acm-automation-poc/job/clc-e2e-pipeline/3223/parameters/"
```

**Fallback Methods:**
- WebFetch tool for when curl encounters certificate issues
- Direct API access with authentication for private instances
- Local artifact processing for downloaded build data

   - Metadata: Extract build status, duration, timestamps, and environment parameters
3. **Environment Validation**: Connect to actual test cluster using extracted parameters and validate product functionality
4. **Repository Analysis**: Analyze automation codebase for test logic understanding and pattern detection
5. **Cross-Service Evidence Correlation**: Correlate findings from environment validation and repository analysis
6. **Definitive Classification**: Generate evidence-based PRODUCT BUG | AUTOMATION BUG | AUTOMATION GAP verdict
7. **Fix Generation**: Create precise automation solutions based on real repository analysis with exact implementations
8. **Report Generation**: Create comprehensive analysis with implementation roadmap
