## 🔧 Configuration and Usage

### Service Configuration
Each AI service is configured through specialized markdown files in `.claude/ai-services/`:

1. **environment-validation-service.md** - Environment connectivity and validation configuration
2. **automation-repository-analysis-service.md** - Repository analysis and pattern detection settings
3. **fix-generation-service.md** - Fix generation and PR automation configuration  
4. **ai-services-integration.md** - Service orchestration and coordination settings

### Usage Patterns

#### Comprehensive Analysis (Recommended)
```bash
# From root repository
/analyze-pipeline-failures https://jenkins-server/job/pipeline/123/

# Natural language interface  
"Analyze this Jenkins pipeline failure: https://jenkins-url/"
```

#### Direct Service Access (Advanced)
```bash
cd apps/z-stream-analysis

# Environment validation focused
"Validate product functionality for this Jenkins failure: https://jenkins-url/"

# Repository analysis focused
"Analyze automation repository for this test failure: https://jenkins-url/"

# Fix generation focused
"Generate merge-ready fixes for these automation issues: https://jenkins-url/"
```

#### Service Debugging
```bash
