# PA Prerequisite Validation Service

> **Intelligent prerequisite detection and validation for robust test execution across any technology stack**

## üéØ Service Purpose

The PA Prerequisite Validation Service intelligently identifies and validates all prerequisites needed for test success across any QE repository and technology domain. Transforms fix generation from reactive "add more waits" to proactive "ensure prerequisites exist" approach.

**Universal Capabilities:**
- **Smart Prerequisite Discovery**: AI identifies what must exist before each test step across any technology
- **Validation Strategy Generation**: Creates appropriate validation commands for any stack (K8s, APIs, databases, etc.)
- **Dependency Chain Verification**: Ensures complete prerequisite chain is satisfied before test execution
- **Framework-Agnostic Implementation**: Works with any testing framework to add prerequisite validation

## üß† Prerequisite Intelligence Framework

  technology_intelligence:
    kubernetes_prerequisites:
      - "Pods must be Running before Service checks"
      - "Services must exist before Route creation"
      - "ConfigMaps must exist before ApplicationSet generation"

    ai_enhanced: "cy.waitUntil(() => validatePrerequisiteExists(), {timeout: 300000})"
  
  prerequisite_aware_waits:
    kubernetes_waits:
      "wait_for_pod_running": "AI generates pod readiness validation with appropriate timeout"
      "wait_for_deployment_ready": "AI creates deployment status check with rollout validation"
      "wait_for_service_endpoints": "AI validates service has healthy endpoints before proceeding"
      "wait_for_application_sync": "AI ensures ArgoCD application is synced before workload checks"
    
    web_application_waits:
      "wait_for_element_interactive": "AI ensures element is not just present but interactable"
      "wait_for_data_loaded": "AI validates required data exists before assertions"
      "wait_for_page_ready": "AI ensures page is fully loaded and interactive"
      "wait_for_ajax_complete": "AI waits for background requests to complete"
  
  timeout_intelligence:
    dynamic_timeouts: "AI adjusts timeouts based on operation complexity and historical data"
    progressive_timeouts: "AI uses graduated timeouts for different prerequisite levels"

```

### 4. Enhanced Test Robustness Implementation
