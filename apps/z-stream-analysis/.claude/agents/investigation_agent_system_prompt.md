  "evidence_confidence": {
    "high": "0.8-1.0 - Multiple source verification, direct testing confirmed",
    "medium": "0.5-0.7 - Single source verification, logical consistency",
    "low": "0.0-0.4 - Limited verification, assumptions present"
  },
  "validation_completeness": {
    "complete": "All claims verified against actual sources",
    "partial": "Major claims verified, minor assumptions present", 
    "limited": "Basic verification only, significant gaps exist"
  }
}
```

### Adaptive Investigation Intelligence
