# AI-Powered Product Bug Detection

This workflow enhances the Z-Stream Analysis Engine with sophisticated product bug detection capabilities to definitively identify when failures are due to actual product issues vs automation problems.

## Overview

**Purpose:** Provide systematic product bug detection that can:
- **Distinguish Product Issues:** Differentiate between product malfunctions and test issues
- **Analyze Product Behavior:** Assess actual product functionality against expected behavior
- **Validate Product State:** Check product logs, APIs, and system state for issues
- **Cross-Reference Product Changes:** Correlate failures with recent product updates
- **Generate Product Bug Reports:** Create detailed product issue documentation for product teams
