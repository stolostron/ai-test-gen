# AI-Powered Quality Assurance Workflows

This document defines comprehensive AI-powered quality assurance workflows that ensure robust, consistent, and high-quality pipeline failure analysis results.

## Overview

Replace traditional validation scripts with intelligent AI quality assurance that provides:
- **Automated Quality Validation:** AI validates completeness, accuracy, and professional standards
- **Intelligent Error Detection:** AI identifies missing information, inconsistencies, and quality issues
- **Adaptive Quality Metrics:** AI adjusts quality criteria based on data availability and context
- **Continuous Improvement:** AI learns from quality patterns to improve future analyses

## Quality Assurance Workflows

### 1. AI Data Quality Validation
**Purpose:** Validate curl-extracted Jenkins data for completeness and usability  
**Trigger:** After data extraction, before analysis processing  
**AI Service:** Data quality assessment and remediation guidance

```markdown
## AI Task: Validate Jenkins Data Quality

Assess the quality and completeness of extracted Jenkins data:

**Raw Data Sources:**
- Metadata: [metadata.json content]
- Console Log: [console.log sample - first/last 50 lines + error sections]
- Test Results: [test-results.json content]
- Artifacts List: [artifacts-list.txt content]

**Quality Assessment Framework:**

1. **Data Completeness Validation:**
   - Metadata: Build info, status, duration, timestamps present
   - Console: Sufficient log content for analysis (not truncated)
   - Test Results: Test execution data available
   - Error Information: Failure details accessible

2. **Data Quality Checks:**
   - JSON validity for structured data
   - Log readability and error message extraction
   - Timestamp consistency across data sources
   - Build status correlation with failure indicators

3. **Analysis Readiness Assessment:**
   - Sufficient information for failure classification
   - Error details adequate for root cause analysis
   - Context information available for impact assessment
   - Remediation planning data accessibility

**Required Output:**
```json
{
  "data_quality": {
    "overall_score": "excellent|good|adequate|insufficient",
    "completeness": {
      "metadata": "complete|partial|missing",
      "console_log": "complete|partial|missing", 
      "test_results": "complete|partial|missing",
      "artifacts": "available|limited|unavailable"
    },
    "quality_issues": [
      {
        "category": "data_category",
        "issue": "description",

    ]
  },
  "extraction_suggestions": [
    "alternative_data_source_1",
    "additional_extraction_command_2"
  ]
}
