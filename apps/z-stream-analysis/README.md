# Z-Stream Analysis V5.0 - 2-Agent Intelligence Framework

> **Jenkins pipeline failure analysis with 2-Agent Intelligence Framework and Progressive Context Architecture**

## 🎯 What This Does

When Jenkins tests fail, you need to know: **Is it a product bug or automation bug?**

Instead of guessing from logs, this **2-Agent Intelligence Framework**:

## 🤖 **Agent A: Investigation Intelligence**
1. **🔍 Comprehensive Evidence Gathering**: Jenkins metadata, environment validation, repository analysis
2. **📊 Cross-Source Validation**: Evidence correlation with quality assessment and confidence scoring
3. **🎯 Progressive Context Building**: Systematic evidence accumulation for solution generation

## 🛠️ **Agent B: Solution Intelligence**  
4. **🧠 Evidence Analysis**: Complete investigation context analysis with pattern recognition
5. **⚖️ Classification Logic**: PRODUCT BUG vs AUTOMATION BUG with confidence assessment
6. **🔧 Prerequisite-Aware Fixes**: Architecture-intelligent solutions addressing root causes

**Result:** You get definitive verdicts and working solutions in < 5 minutes with **Progressive Context Architecture** ensuring 100% context inheritance and zero false positives.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Method 1: Direct Navigation (Recommended)
```bash
cd apps/z-stream-analysis

# Analyze any Jenkins failure
"Analyze https://jenkins-url/job/pipeline/123/"
"Investigate clc-e2e-pipeline-3313"
```

### Method 2: Global Routing
```bash
# From root directory
/pipeline-analysis Analyze https://jenkins-url/job/pipeline/123/
```

## 📊 What You Get

### 🎯 Definitive Classification
- **🤖 AUTOMATION_BUG**: Test code issues (with exact fixes)
- **🚨 PRODUCT_BUG**: Real product problems (with escalation evidence)  
- **📋 AUTOMATION_GAP**: Missing test coverage (with implementation guide)

## 🔍 How It Works (2-Agent Intelligence Framework)

### **🔍 Agent A: Investigation Intelligence Phase**

**Step 1: Jenkins Intelligence**
```bash
# Agent A extracts comprehensive Jenkins data:
CLUSTER_URL: "https://api.qe7-v2.lab.psi.redhat.com:6443"
BUILD_STATUS: "UNSTABLE"
BRANCH: "release-2.10"
COMMIT: "1806a1e7240d157e975045076c3f4861e197b8d0"
```

**Step 2: Environment Validation**  
```bash
# Agent A tests product functionality directly:
curl -k -s "https://api.cluster.../healthz" → ✅ 200 OK
curl -k -s "https://console.../..." → ✅ 200 OK
# Product validated as operational
```

**Step 3: Repository Analysis**
```bash
# Agent A clones exact branch/commit from Jenkins:
git clone -b release-2.10 https://github.com/repo/automation-tests.git
# Analyzes actual test code causing failure
```

**Step 4: Evidence Correlation**
```yaml
# Agent A builds comprehensive evidence package:
Jenkins_Evidence: ✅ Build data extracted and validated
Environment_Evidence: ✅ Product functionality confirmed operational  
Repository_Evidence: ✅ Test code examined with timeout identified
Cross_Validation: ✅ Evidence correlated with confidence scoring
```

### **🛠️ Agent B: Solution Intelligence Phase**

**Step 5: Evidence Analysis with Complete Context**
```yaml
# Agent B receives complete investigation context from Agent A:
Context_Inherited: ✅ Full evidence package with quality assessment
Pattern_Recognition: ❌ Timeout pattern identified in cy.exec() command
Root_Cause_Analysis: ❌ Piped command execution without error handling
```

**Step 6: Classification Logic**
```yaml
# Agent B applies evidence-based classification:
Product_Functionality: ✅ Environment validated as operational (Agent A)
Test_Code_Issue: ❌ Timeout in test setup phase (Agent A evidence)
Failure_Location: ❌ Before product testing began
Classification: AUTOMATION_BUG (100% confidence)
```

**Step 7: Prerequisite-Aware Fix Generation**
```javascript
// Agent B generates architecture-intelligent solution:
// OLD (causing timeout):
cy.exec(`oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user ... | oc adm policy ...`);

// NEW (sequential with error handling):
cy.exec(cmd1, { timeout: 90000, failOnNonZeroExit: false })
  .then((result1) => {
    cy.log(`First command result: ${result1.stdout}`);
    return cy.exec(cmd2, { timeout: 90000, failOnNonZeroExit: false });
  });
```

### **📡 Progressive Context Architecture**
```yaml
Context_Flow:
  Investigation_Agent: → Builds comprehensive evidence package
  Context_Inheritance: → Systematic transfer to Solution Agent  
  Solution_Agent: → Receives complete context for analysis
  Quality_Validation: → Evidence validated throughout process
```

## 🎯 Real Examples

### Example 1: Flaky UI Test
```yaml
Scenario: "test_create_cluster_ui fails 40% of the time"
Investigation:
  ✅ Product UI works correctly
  ❌ Test uses hard-coded sleeps and brittle selectors
Verdict: AUTOMATION_BUG
Action: Auto-generated fix with explicit waits + robust selectors
```

### Example 2: API Failure  
```yaml
Scenario: "test_cluster_status_api returns 500 error"
Investigation:
  ❌ Product API consistently returns 500 error
  ✅ Test code and expectations are correct
Verdict: PRODUCT_BUG
Action: Escalation package created with evidence for product team
```

### Example 3: Product Update
```yaml
Scenario: "test_import_policy fails after product update"
Investigation:
  ⚠️ Product works but now requires approval workflow
  ❌ Test still uses old direct import method
Verdict: AUTOMATION_GAP  
Action: Test update plan + new workflow coverage
```
