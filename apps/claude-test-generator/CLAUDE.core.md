- **Documentation** for feature specifications and usage
- **GitHub repositories** for implementation details and PRs

### Universal Compatibility
Works with any software type:
- **ACM** (Advanced Cluster Management)
- **OpenShift** clusters and operators
- **Kubernetes** applications and services
- **Cloud services** and APIs
- **UI components** and workflows
- **Security features** and compliance
- **Performance enhancements** and optimization

## üöÄ Essential Usage

### Natural Language Interface (Recommended)
```bash
"Generate test plan for ACM-22079"
"Generate test plan for ACM-22079 on mist10: Console: https://console-url Creds: user/pass"
"Analyze JIRA-12345 using staging-cluster environment"
```

### Direct Commands
```bash
/analyze {JIRA_ID}                    # Any JIRA project
/generate {JIRA_ID} {ENVIRONMENT}     # With specific environment
```
