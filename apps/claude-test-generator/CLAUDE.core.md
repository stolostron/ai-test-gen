# Application: test-generator
# Working Directory: apps/claude-test-generator/
# Isolation Level: COMPLETE

## ISOLATION ENFORCEMENT
- This configuration ONLY applies in: apps/claude-test-generator/
- NEVER reference files outside this directory
- NEVER reference other applications  
- NEVER load external configurations
- **STRICT APP BOUNDARIES**: Complete containment within app directory enforced by isolation engine
- **HIERARCHICAL ACCESS**: Root level maintains orchestration capabilities, apps completely isolated
- **REAL-TIME MONITORING**: Violation detection and prevention active at `.claude/isolation/`

## 📋 DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: All documentation must follow first-time reader principles:
- ❌ **BLOCKED**: Marketing terms like "Enhanced", "Advanced", "Revolutionary", "Cutting-edge", "Next-generation", "Innovative", "State-of-the-art", "Premium", "Elite", "Ultimate", "Superior"
- ❌ **BLOCKED**: References to "before" and "after" versions or improvements  
- ❌ **BLOCKED**: Promotional language or version comparison content
- ✅ **REQUIRED**: Clear, direct language for readers with no prior system knowledge
- ✅ **REQUIRED**: Functional, descriptive headings and content
- ✅ **REQUIRED**: Professional tone without promotional elements

**Example Corrections**:
- "Framework Overview" → "Framework Overview"
- "Evidence-Based AI Framework" → "Evidence-Based AI Framework"  
- "Before Enhancement (Failure)" → "Problem Analysis"
- "After Enhancement (Prevention)" → "Current Implementation"

**Documentation Standards Reference**: `.claude/docs/documentation-standards.md`

## AI SERVICES PREFIX: tg
All AI services conceptually use prefix: tg (test-generator) for isolation but follow naming convention: service-name.md

- ⏱️ **Progress Indicators**: Status updates for agent completion and next steps
- 🎯 **Task Transparency**: Detailed description of current agent task and objectives

**Terminal Output Format**:
```
**PHASE 0-PRE: Smart Environment Selection**
📋 Smart Environment Selection → User requested: staging-cluster environment
📊 Health validation: staging-cluster (score: 4.2/10 - unhealthy)
⚠️  Fallback triggered: Health score below 7.0 threshold
✅ Selected: qe6-vmware-ibm (score: 8.7/10 - healthy)

**PHASE 0: JIRA FixVersion Awareness Intelligence**
📋 Agent: JIRA FixVersion Service → Validating ACM-22079 version compatibility...
✅ Agent: JIRA FixVersion Service → Version context intelligence complete (ACM 2.15 vs ACM 2.14)
