**Latest Version**: V3.1 - Enterprise AI Services Integration with AI Ultrathink Deep Reasoning
**Framework Status**: Production-ready with complete AI services ecosystem

## 🚨 CRITICAL FRAMEWORK POLICY

### 🤖 MANDATORY AI-POWERED INVESTIGATION PROTOCOL
**Complete Investigation Requirements** (STRICTLY ENFORCED):

- 🔒 **🔍 AI Complete Investigation Protocol**: 3-level deep JIRA analysis + GitHub PR investigation + internet research
- 🔒 **🧠 AI Ultrathink Analysis Service**: Advanced deep reasoning and cognitive analysis
- 🔒 **🔄 AI Cross-Repository Analysis Service**: Development-automation alignment intelligence  
- 🔒 **🎯 AI Smart Test Scoping Service**: Intelligent test optimization and resource allocation
- 🔒 **📚 AI Documentation Intelligence Service**: Red Hat ACM official documentation analysis
- 🔒 **📊 AI Enhanced GitHub Investigation Service**: GitHub CLI priority + WebFetch fallback
- 🔒 **🛡️ AI Environment Services**: Cluster connectivity, authentication, validation, deployment detection

**ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM**:
- ❌ **BLOCKED**: Test generation without complete AI investigation protocol
- ❌ **BLOCKED**: Test generation without AI ultrathink deep analysis for complex changes
- ❌ **BLOCKED**: Strategic recommendations without comprehensive cognitive analysis
- ❌ **BLOCKED**: Cross-repository assessment without development-automation alignment analysis
- ✅ **REQUIRED**: All AI services integration for comprehensive analysis

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Tell me what you want to test:**
