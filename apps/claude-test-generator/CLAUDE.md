## CLAUDE CODE MEMORY HIERARCHY

This configuration uses Claude Code's memory hierarchy for optimal performance:

- **CLAUDE.core.md** - Essential application identity and quick start
- **CLAUDE.features.md** - Framework architecture and implementation details  
- **CLAUDE.policies.md** - Critical policies and enforcement rules

**Memory Loading Order**: Core → Features → Policies (by priority)
