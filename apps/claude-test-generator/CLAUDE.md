# Test Analysis Engine with Cascade Failure Prevention

> **Evidence-Based Framework with Complete Cascade Failure Prevention Architecture**

## 🎯 Application Purpose

Generate focused E2E test plans for any software feature using direct feature testing approach with UI E2E scenarios and comprehensive CLI support. Works with any JIRA ticket across any technology stack, component type, or complexity level.

**Universal Compatibility**: Supports ACM, OpenShift, Kubernetes, cloud services, APIs, UI components, security features, performance enhancements, and any software feature type.

**Framework Status**: Production-ready with complete AI services ecosystem and 100% cascade failure prevention. Universal applicability across any JIRA ticket or software feature type.

## 🏧 Framework Architecture: 3-Stage Intelligence Process

The framework follows a clear **"Gather → Analyze → Build"** approach that maximizes accuracy and quality for any feature type:

### 📊 **Stage 1: Data Collection (Phases 0-Pre through 2.5)**
**"Collect all relevant, useful data from every possible source"**

- **Phase 0-Pre**: Smart environment selection with health validation and qe6 fallback
- **Phase 0**: Version intelligence and compatibility analysis
- **Phase 1**: Parallel foundation analysis (JIRA + Environment)
- **Phase 2**: Parallel deep investigation (Documentation + GitHub)
- **Phase 2.5**: QE automation repository intelligence with ultrathink analysis

### 🧠 **Stage 2: AI Analysis (Phase 3)**
**"Make sense of ALL the collected data and create strategic intelligence"**

- **Complexity Detection**: Optimal test case sizing for any feature type
- **Ultrathink Analysis**: Deep reasoning and strategic priorities
- **Smart Scoping**: Optimal testing boundaries and resource allocation
- **Title Generation**: Professional naming standards

### 🔧 **Stage 3: Report Construction (Phase 4)**
**"Build the professional test plan using strategic intelligence"**

- **Pattern Extension**: Generate tests from proven successful patterns
- **Universal Data Integration**: Real environment data for any component
- **Evidence Validation**: Prevent fictional content throughout
- **Quality Assurance**: Professional test plans ready for execution

**The Power of Sequential Intelligence Building**: Each stage builds the perfect foundation for the next stage, ensuring that by Phase 4, the Pattern Extension Service has everything it needs to construct accurate, professional test plans that work in real environments for any feature type.

1. **✅ Implementation Reality Agent**: NEVER ASSUME - Validates all assumptions against actual codebase
2. **✅ Evidence Validation Engine**: PREVENT FICTIONAL CONTENT - Blocks content generation without implementation evidence  
3. **✅ Evidence-Based Documentation Service**: CODE OVER DOCUMENTATION - Implementation-first approach
4. **✅ Pattern Extension Service**: EXTEND, NEVER INVENT - Pattern-based test generation with 100% traceability
5. **✅ QE Intelligence Service**: ULTRATHINK QE ANALYSIS - Strategic testing pattern intelligence with actual test file verification and sophisticated reasoning
6. **✅ Mid-Stream Context Sharing**: INTELLIGENT COORDINATION - Real-time context sharing between Agent A and Environment Intelligence

**🛡️ CASCADE FAILURE PREVENTION**: 100% prevention of ACM-22079-type cascade failures achieved through comprehensive evidence-based architecture

## 🚨 CRITICAL FRAMEWORK POLICY

### 🎯 MANDATORY E2E DIRECT FEATURE TESTING PROTOCOL

- ❌ **BLOCKED**: Single report generation (must create dual reports)
- ❌ **BLOCKED**: Commands without clear verbal explanations and sample YAMLs
- ❌ **BLOCKED**: Test generation without UI E2E focus
- ✅ **REQUIRED**: MANDATORY JIRA fixVersion awareness intelligence with continued comprehensive analysis
- ✅ **REQUIRED**: Direct feature testing with UI E2E scenarios and CLI support
- ✅ **REQUIRED**: 4-10 steps per test case optimized for workflow complexity
- ✅ **REQUIRED**: Dual report generation (test cases + complete analysis)

**ALL test cases MUST start with:**
```
**Step 1: Log into ACM Console** - Access ACM Console for [specific feature] testing: Navigate to https://console-openshift-console.apps.<cluster-host>
```

### 🚫 CRITICAL VIOLATIONS TO AVOID
- ❌ **NO Foundation Validation**: No "establish foundation" or "infrastructure readiness" language
- ❌ **NO Knowledge Prerequisites**: No "understanding of" or "knowledge of" sections
- ❌ **NO API Analysis Testing**: Focus on E2E scenarios, not API structure analysis
- ❌ **NO Exceeding 10 Steps**: Strict limit - create more test cases instead
- ❌ **NO Single Report**: Must generate both test cases and complete analysis reports
- ❌ **NO Specific Test Environment URLs**: Test cases must be environment-agnostic with <cluster-host> placeholders
- ❌ **NO Incomplete YAML Examples**: Always provide full YAML configurations, not just file names or partial content
- ❌ **NO Single Method Steps**: Provide both UI Method and CLI Method when applicable

## 🔒 Framework Self-Containment Policy

**All Required Dependencies Included:**
- ✅ AI Investigation Services (internal)
- ✅ AI Environment Services (internal) 
- ✅ AI Validation Services (internal)
- ✅ Framework Templates and Workflows (internal)
- ✅ No external dependencies outside this directory

## 🚨 REGRESSION PREVENTION SYSTEM

**MANDATORY**: Read `.claude/REGRESSION_PREVENTION_MASTER.md` before ANY test generation
- ✅ Enforces proven template structures
- ✅ Prevents format deviations
- ✅ Maintains 85+ quality scores
- ✅ Ensures consistent output across sessions
- ✅ Validates against established patterns
- ✅ Implements cognitive load management

## 🚨 MANDATORY RUN ORGANIZATION POLICY

**SINGLE CONSOLIDATED DIRECTORY ENFORCEMENT** (STRICTLY ENFORCED):
- 🔒 **ALL agent outputs MUST be saved to ONE main run directory**
- 🔒 **NO separate agent directories allowed (consolidation required)**
- 🔒 **ALL phases MUST save results to main run directory**
- 🔒 **Agent-specific files saved with descriptive names in main directory**
- 🔒 **Empty agent directories MUST be cleaned up after consolidation**
- 🔒 **AUTOMATIC CLEANUP ENFORCEMENT**: Framework MUST consolidate and remove separate agent directories at end of run
- 🔒 **SINGLE DIRECTORY GUARANTEE**: Only ONE final directory should exist per run in /runs/ folder

**MANDATORY CLEANUP PROCEDURE**:
- **During Run**: Agents may create temporary directories for processing
- **Final Deliverables Only**: ONLY final deliverable files should remain in run directory
- **Required Files**: Test Cases Report + Complete Analysis Report + run-metadata.json
- **Remove All Intermediate Files**: ALL agent analysis files and temporary outputs MUST be deleted
- **Final State**: Only 3 files should exist in final run directory (Test Cases, Complete Analysis, Metadata)
- **🔒 CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT**: Any files like `agent-*-results.md`, `*-analysis.md`, `*-investigation.md` MUST be removed
- **🔒 ZERO TOLERANCE**: Framework completion requires verification that ONLY 3 final deliverable files remain

**Configuration**: `.claude/config/run-organization-config.json` enforces single directory policy with automatic consolidation rules and cleanup procedures.
