- ❌ **BLOCKED**: Knowledge prerequisite sections in test cases
- ❌ **BLOCKED**: API analysis testing (focus on E2E scenarios)
- ❌ **BLOCKED**: Single report generation (must create dual reports)
- ❌ **BLOCKED**: Commands without clear verbal explanations and sample YAMLs
- ❌ **BLOCKED**: Test generation without UI E2E focus
- ✅ **REQUIRED**: MANDATORY JIRA fixVersion awareness intelligence with continued comprehensive analysis
- ✅ **REQUIRED**: Direct feature testing with UI E2E scenarios and CLI support
- ✅ **REQUIRED**: 4-10 steps per test case optimized for workflow complexity
- ✅ **REQUIRED**: Dual report generation (test cases + complete analysis)

```
**PHASE 0: JIRA FixVersion Awareness Intelligence**
📋 Agent: JIRA FixVersion Service → Validating ACM-22079 version compatibility...
✅ Agent: JIRA FixVersion Service → Version context intelligence complete (ACM 2.15 vs ACM 2.14)

### **Phase 1a: Independent Parallel Execution**
- **Agent A (JIRA Analysis)**: Complete hierarchy analysis
- **Agent D (Environment Validation)**: Cluster authentication and validation (parallel)

### **Phase 1b: Context-Informed Feature Detection**

- 🔒 **ALL phases MUST save results to main run directory**
- 🔒 **Agent-specific files saved with descriptive names in main directory**
- 🔒 **Empty agent directories MUST be cleaned up after consolidation**

**Configuration**: `.claude/config/run-organization-config.json` enforces single directory policy with automatic consolidation rules and cleanup procedures.

**Key Components:**
- `.claude/templates/template-validation-system.md` - Automated enforcement
- `.claude/config/regression-prevention.json` - Quality gates and triggers
- `.claude/config/qe-repo-mapping.json` - QE repository intelligence mapping with team restrictions

kind: ClusterCurator
metadata:
  name: example-test
  namespace: target-cluster
spec:
  desiredCuration: upgrade
  cluster: target-cluster
