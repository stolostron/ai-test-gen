### üö® CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS - ENFORCED BY VALIDATION

**Quality Target: 85-95+ points** (Category-aware scoring with AI validation - Upgrade/Security: 95+, Import/Export: 92+, UI: 90+, Tech Preview: 88+)

### ‚ùå ZERO TOLERANCE FAILURES (CAUSES IMMEDIATE VALIDATION FAILURE)
1. **2-COLUMN TABLE FORMAT**: Must use exactly 2 columns (Step | Expected Result) - causes 15-point deduction for 3-column format
2. **ACCURATE DEPLOYMENT VALIDATION**: Must correlate ACM/MCE versions with feature availability - causes 20-point deduction for incorrect status
3. **FULL COMMANDS**: Must provide complete commands with proper placeholders - causes 10-point deduction for generic placeholders
4. **üö® CRITICAL: NO HTML TAGS ANYWHERE**: STRICTLY FORBIDDEN - Never use `<br/>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, `<div>`, or any HTML tags in markdown code blocks or anywhere else - causes 25-point deduction for ANY HTML tag usage (AI-powered detection enabled)
5. **EXACT LOGIN FORMAT**: Must use exact Step 1 format - causes 15-point deduction if wrong
6. **DEPLOYMENT STATUS HEADER**: Must use `## üö® DEPLOYMENT STATUS` exactly - causes 15-point deduction if wrong
7. **VERBAL EXPLANATION REQUIREMENT**: Expected Results MUST include verbal explanation of what terminal outputs mean, not just raw output - causes 20-point deduction if missing
8. **DEFINITIVE TEST CASE FOCUS**: All test cases must clearly outline verification procedures for specific features or aspects, using clear testing language (e.g., "Verify...", "Test...", "Validate...") with definitive steps that prove functionality - causes 15-point deduction for vague investigative language
9. **NO INTERNAL AI PROCESSES**: Never mention internal AI environment setup processes in user-facing content - causes 10-point deduction (AI-powered prevention enabled)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY TEST TABLE FORMAT REQUIREMENTS
**Enhanced Test Case Standards** (85+ points required):
- ‚úÖ **CRITICAL: 2-Column Format ONLY**: Test tables MUST use exactly 2 columns (Step | Expected Result) - NO 3-column formats
- ‚úÖ **Step Column Content**: Include verbal instructions + commands in Step column (e.g., "**Step 1: Log into the ACM hub cluster** - Access the hub cluster using credentials: `oc login https://api.cluster.com:6443 --username=kubeadmin --password=<password>`")
- ‚úÖ **Full Commands Required**: Provide complete commands with proper placeholders (not generic `<cluster-url>`)
- ‚úÖ **Verbal Explanations Required**: NEVER start test steps with only commands - always include verbal instructions
- ‚úÖ **Sample Outputs Mandatory**: Include realistic sample outputs in triple backticks for ALL steps that fetch/update data
- ‚úÖ **NO HTML Tags Policy**: STRICTLY FORBIDDEN - use ` - ` instead of `<br/>` tags
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Tester Experience**: Provide clear expectations with realistic data examples
