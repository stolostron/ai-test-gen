### 🚨 CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS - ENFORCED BY VALIDATION

**Quality Target: 85-95+ points** (Category-aware scoring with AI validation - Upgrade/Security: 95+, Import/Export: 92+, UI: 90+, Tech Preview: 88+)

### ❌ ZERO TOLERANCE FAILURES (CAUSES IMMEDIATE VALIDATION FAILURE)
1. **2-COLUMN TABLE FORMAT**: Must use exactly 2 columns (Step | Expected Result) - causes 15-point deduction for 3-column format
2. **ACCURATE DEPLOYMENT VALIDATION**: Must correlate ACM/MCE versions with feature availability - causes 20-point deduction for incorrect status
3. **FULL COMMANDS**: Must provide complete commands with proper placeholders - causes 10-point deduction for generic placeholders
4. **🚨 CRITICAL: NO HTML TAGS ANYWHERE**: STRICTLY FORBIDDEN - Never use `<br/>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, `<div>`, or any HTML tags in markdown code blocks or anywhere else - causes 25-point deduction for ANY HTML tag usage (AI-powered detection enabled)
5. **EXACT LOGIN FORMAT**: Must use exact Step 1 format - causes 15-point deduction if wrong
6. **DEPLOYMENT STATUS HEADER**: Must use `## 🚨 DEPLOYMENT STATUS` exactly - causes 15-point deduction if wrong
7. **VERBAL EXPLANATION REQUIREMENT**: Expected Results MUST include verbal explanation of what terminal outputs mean, not just raw output - causes 20-point deduction if missing
8. **DEFINITIVE TEST CASE FOCUS**: All test cases must clearly outline verification procedures for specific features or aspects, using clear testing language (e.g., "Verify...", "Test...", "Validate...") with definitive steps that prove functionality - causes 15-point deduction for vague investigative language
9. **NO INTERNAL AI PROCESSES**: Never mention internal AI environment setup processes in user-facing content - causes 10-point deduction (AI-powered prevention enabled)

### ⚠️ MANDATORY TEST TABLE FORMAT REQUIREMENTS
**Enhanced Test Case Standards** (85+ points required):
- ✅ **CRITICAL: 2-Column Format ONLY**: Test tables MUST use exactly 2 columns (Step | Expected Result) - NO 3-column formats
- ✅ **Step Column Content**: Include verbal instructions + commands in Step column (e.g., "**Step 1: Log into the ACM hub cluster** - Access the hub cluster using credentials: `oc login https://api.cluster.com:6443 --username=kubeadmin --password=<password>`")
- ✅ **Full Commands Required**: Provide complete commands with proper placeholders (not generic `<cluster-url>`)
- ✅ **Verbal Explanations Required**: NEVER start test steps with only commands - always include verbal instructions
- ✅ **Sample Outputs Mandatory**: Include realistic sample outputs in triple backticks for ALL steps that fetch/update data

### 🔍 Critical Feature Implementation Validation ⚠️ MANDATORY

**🚨 ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: THOROUGH FEATURE DEPLOYMENT VALIDATION 🚨**

**ENFORCEMENT POLICY**: The framework MUST perform comprehensive validation of actual feature implementation in the test environment - NOT just infrastructure availability.

**BEFORE generating test cases**, the AI framework MUST ALWAYS:
1. **AI PR Analysis**: Find and analyze ALL implementation PRs via AI GitHub Investigation Service - NO EXCEPTIONS
2. **AI Internet Research**: Research technology, docs, and best practices via AI services - REQUIRED
3. **AI Schema Validation**: Inspect actual field structures and behaviors via AI Schema Service
4. **AI Architecture Discovery**: Understand operational patterns through AI investigation
5. **🔒 AI FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION VALIDATION**: **MANDATORY THOROUGH VALIDATION** - Validate that ALL specific changes from the PR are actually deployed and working in the test environment
6. **🔒 AI DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION**: **MANDATORY EVIDENCE-BASED ASSESSMENT** - Use AI to thoroughly test and verify the feature is operational with concrete evidence
7. **AI Feedback Loop**: Quality assessment and iterative improvement via AI
8. **AI Documentation**: Full transparency of research and validation process via AI services

**🚨 CRITICAL: FEATURE DEPLOYMENT VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS**:
- ❌ **NEVER ASSUME**: Infrastructure availability = Feature deployment
- ✅ **ALWAYS VALIDATE**: Every specific change from the PR is deployed and functional
- ✅ **PROVIDE EVIDENCE**: Concrete validation data proving feature deployment status
- ✅ **TEST BEHAVIOR**: Actual feature behavior validation through intelligent testing
- ✅ **CLEAR VERDICT**: Definitive deployment status with supporting evidence

**FAILURE TO COMPLETE THOROUGH IMPLEMENTATION VALIDATION = INVALID TEST GENERATION**

### 🎯 Investigation Protocol ⚠️ MANDATORY - STRICTLY ENFORCED

3. **AI Domain Learning**: Domain-specific knowledge for accurate testing
4. **AI Assumption Validation**: Against authoritative sources

**Step 4: AI THOROUGH FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION VALIDATION** (MANDATORY):

**🔒 COMPREHENSIVE FEATURE DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION** - This is the CRITICAL validation stage that determines if the feature is actually deployed and operational.

**4A. AI Schema & Infrastructure Validation**:
1. **AI Schema Service**: Deep schema inspection and field validation
2. **AI Cluster Testing**: Components and behaviors analysis
3. **AI Architecture Discovery**: Operational pattern analysis

**4B. AI FEATURE-SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION VALIDATION** ⚠️ **MANDATORY THOROUGH TESTING**:
1. **PR Change Validation**: For EACH specific change in the implementation PR:
   - Validate the exact code change is deployed in the environment
   - Test the specific behavior modification is functional
   - Verify new fields, annotations, or logic are operational
   - Confirm integration points work as implemented

2. **Behavioral Validation**: Use AI to intelligently test feature behavior:
   - Create and apply test resources with the new functionality
   - Validate expected behaviors occur as designed
   - Test edge cases and error conditions
   - Verify integration with existing systems

3. **Evidence-Based Assessment**: Generate concrete evidence of deployment status:
   - **DEPLOYED**: Feature fully operational with validation evidence
   - **PARTIALLY DEPLOYED**: Some components working, others missing (with specifics)
   - **NOT DEPLOYED**: Feature not available in environment (with evidence)
   - **IMPLEMENTATION BUG**: Feature deployed but not working correctly (with error details)

4. **Version & Release Correlation** ⚠️ **CRITICAL ADDITION**:
   - **ACM/MCE Version Checking**: Correlate current environment version with feature availability
   - **Container image analysis and version correlation**
   - **PR merge date to release cycle mapping**
   - **Clear distinction between "implemented" vs. "deployed"**
   - **Feature roadmap analysis**: When will feature be available in current environment
   - **Deployment timeline analysis and availability prediction**

5. **AI-Powered Enhanced Validation System** ⚠️ **DEFINITIVE DEPLOYMENT ASSESSMENT**:
   - **Multi-Source Evidence Collection**: Combine version checking, behavioral testing, and schema validation
   - **Concrete Supporting Data**: Generate irrefutable proof of deployment status with specific evidence
   - **Intelligent Cross-Validation**: AI correlates multiple data points to eliminate false positives/negatives
   - **Definitive Verdict Generation**: AI provides unambiguous deployment status with comprehensive justification
   - **Evidence Documentation**: Full transparency of all validation data and reasoning used in assessment
   - **Error Prevention**: AI prevents incorrect deployment assessments through rigorous multi-stage validation

**🚨 ENHANCED ENFORCEMENT**: The AI-powered framework MUST leverage its enhanced validation system to provide definitive deployment status with irrefutable supporting evidence. The AI system prevents incorrect assessments through multi-source validation and intelligent cross-correlation. Speculation or assumptions are STRICTLY PROHIBITED.

**Step 5: AI Missing Data Handling** (MANDATORY):
1. **AI Gap Detection**: Detect gaps and quantify impact
2. **AI Documentation**: Limitations and assumptions via AI services
3. **AI Roadmap**: Future roadmap for complete testing via AI planning

### 📊 Quality Standards

**🚨 MANDATORY: Always Generate Comprehensive E2E Test Plans**:
- **REGARDLESS OF DEPLOYMENT STATUS**: Generate complete test plans even if feature is not deployed, partially deployed, or validation fails
- **COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE**: Test cases must cover ALL aspects of the feature using E2E approach with different scenarios
- **DEFINITIVE VERIFICATION**: Each test case must clearly outline how to verify specific functionality with concrete steps
- **FEATURE-COMPLETE TESTING**: Cover happy path, error scenarios, edge cases, and integration points
- **DEPLOYMENT-INDEPENDENT**: Test cases should work when feature becomes available, regardless of current limitations
- **E2E METHODOLOGY**: Follow end-to-end testing patterns from setup through cleanup
- **SCENARIO DIVERSITY**: Include multiple test scenarios to ensure comprehensive feature validation
- **🚨 CRITICAL: TEST TABLE SIZE LIMIT**: Each test table MUST have maximum 8-10 steps - if verification requires more steps, create additional test tables to ensure full coverage
