## 🔒 TECHNICAL ENFORCEMENT IMPLEMENTATION

### 🚨 MANDATORY PHASE 4 TECHNICAL VALIDATION

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Before ANY Write tool usage during Phase 4, execute technical validation to prevent HTML tag violations and format breaches.

**Technical Enforcement Components:**
- **📁 `.claude/enforcement/`** - Technical enforcement module with executable validation
- **🐍 `format_validator.py`** - Core validation engine with HTML tag detection
- **🔒 `pre_write_validator.py`** - Pre-Write validation service with blocking authority
- **📋 `phase4_enforcement_protocol.md`** - Mandatory technical validation protocol

### 🔧 MANDATORY VALIDATION PROCESS

**STEP 1: Content Preparation**
```
Prepare content following documented format requirements
```

**STEP 2: MANDATORY TECHNICAL VALIDATION** 
```bash
# REQUIRED: Execute before Write tool usage
python .claude/enforcement/pre_write_validator.py "<file_path>" "<content>"

# Returns:
# Exit code 0: Content approved - proceed with Write
# Exit code 1: Content BLOCKED - fix violations before proceeding
```

**STEP 3: CONDITIONAL WRITE**
- **IF validation passes**: Proceed with Write tool
- **IF validation fails**: Fix violations and re-validate

### 🚨 TECHNICAL BLOCKING PATTERNS

**HTML Tag Detection (CRITICAL_BLOCK):**
```python
html_patterns = [
    r'<br\s*/?>'     # Blocks: <br>, <br/>, <br >
    r'<[^>]+>'       # Blocks: Any HTML tags
    r'&lt;|&gt;|&amp;' # Blocks: HTML entities
]
```

**YAML Block HTML Prevention (CRITICAL_BLOCK):**
```python
yaml_html_patterns = [
    r'yaml<br>'              # Blocks: yaml<br> (original violation pattern)
    r'yaml.*<br>.*apiVersion' # Blocks: HTML in YAML blocks
    r'<br>\s*apiVersion'     # Blocks: <br> before YAML properties
]
```

### ✅ ENFORCEMENT GUARANTEE

**TECHNICAL ENFORCEMENT PROMISE:**
- ✅ **Executable validation**: Real Python scripts with blocking authority
- ✅ **HTML tag prevention**: 100% blocking of `<br/>` and all HTML violations
- ✅ **Phase 4 integration**: Mandatory validation before Write tool usage
- ✅ **Audit compliance**: Complete logging of all validation attempts

## 🚨 MANDATORY RUN ORGANIZATION POLICY

**SINGLE CONSOLIDATED DIRECTORY ENFORCEMENT** (STRICTLY ENFORCED):

- 🔒 **NO separate agent directories allowed (consolidation required)**
- 🔒 **ALL phases MUST save results to main run directory**
- 🔒 **Agent-specific files saved with descriptive names in main directory**
- 🔒 **Empty agent directories MUST be cleaned up after consolidation**
- 🔒 **AUTOMATIC CLEANUP ENFORCEMENT**: Framework MUST consolidate and remove separate agent directories at end of run
- 🔒 **SINGLE DIRECTORY GUARANTEE**: Only ONE final directory should exist per run in /runs/ folder

**MANDATORY CLEANUP PROCEDURE**:
- **During Run**: Agents may create temporary directories for processing
- **Final Deliverables Only**: ONLY final deliverable files should remain in run directory
- **Required Files**: Test Cases Report + Complete Analysis Report + run-metadata.json

- **🔒 CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT**: Any files like `agent-*-results.md`, `*-analysis.md`, `*-investigation.md` MUST be removed
- **🔒 ZERO TOLERANCE**: Framework completion requires verification that ONLY 3 final deliverable files remain

## 🚨 REGRESSION PREVENTION SYSTEM

- ✅ Enforces proven template structures
- ✅ Prevents format deviations
- ✅ Maintains 85+ quality scores
