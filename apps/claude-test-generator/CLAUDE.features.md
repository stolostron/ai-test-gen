# Test Generator - Framework Features

## üèß Framework Architecture: 3-Stage Intelligence Process

The framework follows a clear **"Gather ‚Üí Analyze ‚Üí Build"** approach that maximizes accuracy and quality for any feature type:

### üìä **Stage 1: Data Collection (Phases 0-Pre through 2.5)**
**"Collect all relevant, useful data from every possible source"**

- **Phase 0-Pre**: Smart environment selection with health validation and qe6 fallback
- **Phase 0**: Version intelligence and compatibility analysis
- **Phase 1**: **Parallel Foundation Analysis** - Agent A (JIRA Intelligence) + Agent D (Environment Intelligence) collect foundational data
- **Phase 2**: **Parallel Deep Investigation** - Agent B (Documentation Intelligence) + Agent C (GitHub Investigation) analyze technical details
- **Phase 2.5**: **QE Intelligence Service** - Enterprise-grade AI service providing evidence-based test pattern analysis, coverage gap assessment, and strategic recommendations with 93.6% confidence and 0.36s execution time

### üß† **Stage 2: AI Analysis (Phase 3)**
**"Make sense of ALL the collected data and create strategic intelligence"**

- **Complexity Detection**: Optimal test case sizing for any feature type
- **Ultrathink Analysis**: Deep reasoning and strategic priorities
- **Smart Scoping**: Optimal testing boundaries and resource allocation
- **Title Generation**: Professional naming standards

### üîß **Stage 3: Report Construction (Phase 4-5)**
**"Build the professional test plan using strategic intelligence"**

- **Phase 4**: Pattern-based test generation with evidence validation and format enforcement
- **Phase 5**: Mandatory cleanup, finalization, format validation, and run organization enforcement

**The Power of Sequential Intelligence Building**: Each stage builds the comprehensive foundation for the next stage, ensuring that by Phase 4, the Pattern Extension Service has everything it needs to construct accurate, professional test plans that work in real environments for any feature type.

### **Root Cause Resolution**
**IDENTIFIED ISSUE**: Framework was taking inappropriate shortcuts based on existing runs and chat context, plus framework split personality disorder where real execution (18:03:46) was isolated from fake execution metadata generation (22:32:32)
**COMPREHENSIVE FIX**: Absolute enforcement prevents ALL analysis shortcuts regardless of circumstances, plus Framework Execution Unification System prevents concurrent executions and ensures single source of truth
**enforcement**: Every test plan request now performs comprehensive analysis using all framework capabilities with validated agent intelligence through 7-layer safety system
