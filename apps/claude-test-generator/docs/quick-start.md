# Quick Start Guide

> **Evidence-Based Framework with Complete Cascade Failure Prevention**

## 🛡️ **Framework Status**

**✅ COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION**: 4-Agent Architecture with comprehensive AI services ecosystem
- 🎯 **4-Agent Architecture**: Agent A (JIRA), Agent B (Documentation), Agent C (GitHub), Agent D (Environment) 
- 🛡️ **Implementation Reality Agent**: Foundational evidence validation
- ⚖️ **Cross-Agent Validation Engine**: Continuous monitoring with framework halt authority
- 📋 **Evidence-Based Documentation**: Implementation-first analysis
- 🎯 **Pattern Extension Service**: 100% pattern traceability
- 🧠 **QE Intelligence Service**: Ultrathink reasoning with strategic testing pattern intelligence
- 🔄 **Context Sharing Service**: Real-time Agent A ↔ Agent D coordination with progressive enhancement
- 🎆 **3-Stage Intelligence Process**: Gather → Analyze → Build methodology

## 🚀 **Most Common Usage**

### Navigate to Framework
```bash
cd apps/claude-test-generator
```

### Analyze JIRA Ticket with Framework
Simply ask Claude for **evidence-based analysis**:
```
"Please analyze ACM-12345 and generate E2E test cases"
```

**Framework Will Automatically:**
1. 🎯 **Execute 4-Agent Investigation** (Agent A: JIRA, Agent B: Documentation, Agent C: GitHub, Agent D: Environment)
2. 🔄 **Real-time Context Sharing** (Agent A ↔ Agent D coordination with 75%→95% confidence enhancement)
3. 🛡️ **Validate against actual codebase** (Implementation Reality Agent)
4. ⚖️ **Monitor for contradictions** (Cross-Agent Validation Engine with framework halt authority)
5. 🧠 **Apply ultrathink QE analysis** (Strategic testing pattern intelligence with sophisticated reasoning)
6. 🎯 **Generate pattern-based tests** (Pattern Extension Service with 100% traceability)
7. 🎆 **Follow 3-stage process** (Gather → Analyze → Build methodology)

### Alternative Commands
```bash
# With evidence validation and specific environment
"Analyze ACM-12345 using my current kubeconfig with complete evidence validation"

# With PR context and pattern validation
"Analyze ACM-12345 and include PR analysis from https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123 with pattern traceability"

# With cascade failure prevention monitoring
"Generate test plan for ACM-12345 with complete framework consistency validation"
```
