## 1. JIRA Analysis Summary
**Ticket Details**: [ACM-22079: Support digest-based upgrades via ClusterCurator for non-recommended upgrades](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ACM-22079)

This feature implements critical digest-based upgrade functionality for ClusterCurator addressing urgent customer requirements for disconnected environments where image tags are insufficient. The implementation enables non-recommended cluster upgrades through image digest specification, providing essential functionality for enterprise environments with strict disconnected deployment requirements and custom upgrade scenarios.

**Key Requirements**:
- ClusterCurator digest-based upgrade support enabling image digest specification for cluster upgrades
- Non-recommended upgrade path support for disconnected environments with custom upgrade scenarios
- Image digest validation and resolution for enterprise registry integration and compatibility
- Disconnected environment compatibility ensuring proper functionality without external registry access
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms for digest resolution failures and upgrade rollback scenarios
- Integration with existing ClusterCurator workflows maintaining backward compatibility and operational consistency

**Business Value**: Addresses critical customer requirement (Amadeus) for disconnected environment cluster upgrades, enables non-recommended upgrade paths through digest specification, and provides essential functionality for enterprise environments with strict connectivity constraints and custom deployment requirements.

## 4. Test Scenarios Analysis
**Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive version-aware ClusterCurator digest upgrade testing covering configuration validation, upgrade execution, error handling, and disconnected environment support across complete upgrade lifecycle management

### Test Case 1: ClusterCurator Digest Configuration and Validation
**Scenario**: Validate digest-based upgrade configuration functionality and proper validation for non-recommended upgrade scenarios
**Purpose**: Ensure proper digest configuration with comprehensive validation and compatibility verification
**Critical Validation**: Digest format validation, configuration accuracy, compatibility checks, registry connectivity
**Customer Value**: Provides reliable digest upgrade configuration ensuring proper setup and validation for disconnected environments

### Test Case 2: ClusterCurator Digest Upgrade Execution and Monitoring
**Scenario**: Execute digest-based cluster upgrades and validate progress monitoring for non-recommended upgrade paths
**Purpose**: Validate upgrade execution with real-time monitoring and comprehensive progress tracking
**Critical Validation**: Upgrade execution, progress monitoring, non-recommended path handling, completion validation
**Customer Value**: Ensures reliable digest-based upgrades with comprehensive monitoring and validation for enterprise environments

### Test Case 3: ClusterCurator Digest Upgrade Error Handling and Recovery
**Scenario**: Verify error handling, validation failures, and recovery mechanisms for various upgrade scenarios
**Purpose**: Ensure robust error handling with comprehensive recovery capabilities and clear guidance
**Critical Validation**: Error detection, recovery mechanisms, rollback functionality, cleanup procedures
**Customer Value**: Provides reliable upgrade experience with comprehensive error handling and recovery options reducing deployment risks

**Comprehensive Coverage Rationale**: These scenarios validate the complete ClusterCurator digest upgrade functionality from configuration validation through upgrade execution and comprehensive error handling. Testing covers both positive scenarios (successful digest upgrades with monitoring) and negative scenarios (error handling, recovery, rollback) ensuring robust digest-based upgrade management across all disconnected environment deployment scenarios with appropriate validation and operational capabilities. Version awareness ensures testing readiness for ACM 2.15.0 feature availability while maintaining comprehensive validation coverage.
