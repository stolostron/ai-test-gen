## 🎯 COMPREHENSIVE TEST VALIDATION FOCUS

### Primary Validation Points (Based on Implementation Analysis)
1. **Annotation Support:** ClusterCurator accepts and processes `upgrade-allow-not-recommended-versions: 'true'`
2. **Job Creation:** Curator job created for upgrade processing with digest logic
3. **Version Processing:** desiredUpdate field processed correctly for non-recommended versions
4. **Feature Control:** Annotation-based control mechanism working as implemented

### Critical Implementation Understanding
- **Managed Cluster Context:** ClusterCurator manages remote clusters, not hub cluster
- **Digest Logic:** Code checks conditional updates for digest, falls back to tag if not found
- **Annotation Control:** Feature controlled by specific annotation as per implementation
- **Test Scope:** Focus on ClusterCurator configuration and job orchestration

### Success Criteria
- ✅ ClusterCurator resource creation with annotation
- ✅ Curator job creation and execution  
- ✅ Proper status condition reporting
- ✅ Annotation-based feature control validation
- ✅ Expected behavior in hub cluster test environment

### Business Validation
- **Customer Requirement:** Amadeus can use annotation for disconnected environment upgrades
- **Implementation Status:** Feature deployed in July 2025 (commit be3fbc0)
- **Integration:** Works with existing ClusterCurator upgrade workflows
- **Digest Logic:** Conditional updates checked for digest before fallback to tag
