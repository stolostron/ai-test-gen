# Complete Analysis: ACM-22079 - Digest-based Upgrades via ClusterCurator

## Implementation Status

**Feature**: Support digest-based upgrades via ClusterCurator for non-recommended upgrades  
**JIRA Ticket**: ACM-22079 (Status: Review - Implementation Complete)  
**GitHub PR**: [#468](https://github.com/stolostron/cluster-curator-controller/pull/468) - "ACM-22079 Initial non-recommended image digest feature" ✅ **MERGED**  
**Target Release**: ACM 2.15.0  
**Business Driver**: Critical customer requirement (Amadeus) for disconnected environment support  

### Key Implementation Details

**Core Functionality**: 3-tier fallback hierarchy for image resolution:
1. **Primary**: Extract digest from `ClusterVersion.status.conditionalUpdates`
2. **Secondary**: Fallback to `ClusterVersion.status.availableUpdates` 
3. **Tertiary**: Use image tag format for backward compatibility

**Required Configuration**:
- **Mandatory Annotation**: `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/upgrade-allow-force: "true"`
- **ClusterCurator Spec**: Standard upgrade specification with `desiredUpdate` version
- **Integration**: ManagedClusterView for ClusterVersion access, ManagedClusterAction for execution

**Files Modified**:
- `pkg/jobs/hive/hive.go`: Core digest resolution logic
- `pkg/jobs/utils/helpers.go`: Helper functions for image handling
- Enhanced error handling with 5-attempt retry mechanism

**Development Environment**: Restored `LoadConfig()` function for local development and testing support

## Environment & Validation Status

**Test Environment**: qe6-vmware-ibm cluster  
**Hub Cluster**: https://api.qe6-vmware-ibm.install.dev09.red-chesterfield.com:6443  
**Authentication**: kubeadmin (generic format for team usability)  

### Version Analysis
- **Current ACM Version**: 2.14.0-62
- **Target ACM Version**: 2.15.0 (Feature implementation target)
- **MCE Version**: 2.9.0-212
- **OpenShift Version**: 4.20.0-ec.4
- **Available Managed Clusters**: local-cluster (ready for testing)

### Schema Validation Results ✅
- **ClusterCurator CRD**: v1beta1 schema validation successful
- **Required Annotation**: `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/upgrade-allow-force` accepted by schema
- **Upgrade Spec**: All required fields (desiredUpdate, monitorTimeout) validated
- **Dry-run Validation**: `oc apply --dry-run=server` successful for test ClusterCurator

### Feature Availability Assessment

**Current Status**: ⚠️ **Feature Not Yet Available**
- **Root Cause Analysis**: ACM-22079 targets ACM 2.15.0, current environment runs ACM 2.14.0-62
- **Cluster-Curator-Controller**: Running version from MCE 2.9.0-212, digest upgrade functionality pending
- **Expected Behavior**: Implementation logic not present in current controller version

**Evidence Supporting Assessment**:
- JIRA Fix Version explicitly states "ACM 2.15.0"
- PR #468 merged July 16, 2025 (post-current deployment)
- Current ClusterCurator controller image predates feature implementation
- Schema validation passes but runtime functionality unavailable

**Deployment Timeline**: Feature expected in next ACM 2.15.0 release cycle
