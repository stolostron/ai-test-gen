## Feature Overview & Business Value

### Customer Value Statement
Urgent request by Amadeus customer to use image digest for non-recommended upgrades as the image tag doesn't work in their disconnected environment. This enhancement will enable ClusterCurator to:

1. **Digest Resolution**: Automatically resolve image digests for non-recommended versions
2. **Disconnected Support**: Support disconnected environments where image tags may not resolve
3. **Fallback Mechanism**: Use image tags when digest resolution fails
4. **Annotation Control**: Use annotation to gate non-recommended upgrades

### Technical Architecture (When Implemented)
- **Component**: ClusterCurator Controller (`cluster-curator-controller`)
- **Namespace**: `multicluster-engine`
- **Current Version**: `quay.io:443/acm-d/cluster-curator-controller-rhel9@sha256:902c5b3b4a4e8cb0a14fa5aba8451ec02830d5167ff1b91323ded62255983cd9`
- **Implementation Status**: Development complete, awaiting deployment to qe6

## Comprehensive Test Plan Strategy

### üéØ Complete Test Coverage (6 Test Cases)

**Test Plan Philosophy**: All test cases assume feature is fully implemented and are ready for immediate execution when deployed.

#### Test Case 1: Core Digest-Based Non-Recommended Upgrade
**Status**: üî¥ Awaiting deployment

**Business Value**: Validates core customer requirement for disconnected environments

#### Test Case 2: Digest Resolution Failure and Tag Fallback  
**Status**: üî¥ Awaiting deployment  
**Coverage**: Fallback mechanism when digest information unavailable  
**Business Value**: Ensures robustness in various network/registry scenarios

#### Test Case 3: Annotation Validation and Security
**Status**: üü° Partially testable (annotation recognition works)  
**Coverage**: Security gating and annotation-based access control  
**Business Value**: Prevents unauthorized non-recommended upgrades

#### Test Case 4: Upgrade Monitoring and Timeout Handling
**Status**: üî¥ Awaiting deployment  
**Coverage**: Digest-specific monitoring and timeout behavior  
**Business Value**: Reliable upgrade tracking and error recovery

#### Test Case 5: Multi-Cluster Digest Upgrade Validation
**Status**: üî¥ Awaiting deployment  
**Coverage**: Scalability across multiple managed clusters  
**Business Value**: Enterprise-scale deployment validation

#### Test Case 6: Error Handling and Recovery Scenarios
**Status**: üî¥ Awaiting deployment  
**Coverage**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery  
**Business Value**: Production-ready robustness and troubleshooting

### Execution Timeline
**Immediate**: Test Case 3 (annotation recognition) - 30 minutes  
**Post-Deployment**: All test cases - 4-5 hours total  
**Environment Ready**: qe6 infrastructure supports full test execution
