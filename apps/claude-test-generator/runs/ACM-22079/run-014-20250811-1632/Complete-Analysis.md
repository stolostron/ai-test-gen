## 🎯 Feature Analysis

### Business Context
- **Customer:** Amadeus (urgent request)
- **Problem:** Image tag-based upgrades fail in disconnected environments
- **Solution:** Use image digest instead of image tag for non-recommended upgrades
- **Impact:** Critical for disconnected environment operations

### Technical Specification
**ClusterCurator Enhancement:**
- Support for digest-based upgrades when specifying non-recommended versions
- Automatic detection of digest requirement for disconnected environments
- Validation that digest is used instead of tag in ClusterVersion resource

## 🔍 Implementation Validation Results

### ✅ Environment Assessment
- **Environment:** qe6-vmware-ibm cluster accessible  
- **OpenShift Version:** 4.19.6 (stable-4.19 channel)
- **ClusterCurator CRD:** ✅ Confirmed available with upgrade.desiredUpdate field
- **ACM Namespace:** ocm (confirmed)

### ✅ Schema Validation
- **ClusterCurator CRD:** `clustercurators.cluster.open-cluster-management.io` exists
- **Key Fields Validated:**
  - `spec.upgrade.desiredUpdate`: ✅ Available for version specification
  - `spec.upgrade.channel`: ✅ Available for channel management
  - **ClusterVersion Resource:** ✅ Available for validation inspection

### 🎯 Test Scope Analysis
**NEW functionality to test:**
1. Digest-based upgrade mechanism for non-recommended versions
2. Validation that ClusterVersion.spec.desiredUpdate.image uses digest format
3. Integration with disconnected environment requirements

**Existing functionality to SKIP:** Standard recommended upgrade paths (already tested)
