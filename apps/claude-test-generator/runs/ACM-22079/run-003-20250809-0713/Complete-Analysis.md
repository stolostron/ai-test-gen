## Feature Deployment Validation Results

### Comprehensive Feature Validation - ACM-22079

**Environment:** https://api.qe6-vmware-ibm.install.dev09.red-chesterfield.com:6443  
**Timestamp:** August 9, 2025 07:13 UTC

#### Component Status Validation
‚úÖ **Controller Deployment**: cluster-curator-controller running in multicluster-engine namespace  
‚úÖ **Image Status**: Using digest-based image `quay.io:443/acm-d/cluster-curator-controller-rhel9@sha256:902c5b3b4a4e8cb0a14fa5aba8451ec02830d5167ff1b91323ded62255983cd9`  
‚úÖ **CRD Schema**: ClusterCurator CRD available with upgrade section and annotation support

#### Feature Logic Validation Results
‚ùå **Digest Resolution Logic**: No evidence of digest lookup or resolution in controller logs  
‚ùå **Conditional Updates Processing**: No conditional update processing patterns found  
‚ùå **Tag Fallback Mechanism**: No fallback logic detected in controller behavior  
‚ùå **Annotation-Specific Logic**: No non-recommended version gating logic found

#### Annotation Recognition Testing
‚úÖ **Annotation Processing**: Controller recognizes and processes the annotation  
‚úÖ **Resource Creation**: ClusterCurator with annotation creates successfully  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Feature Logic**: Annotation processed but no digest-specific behavior triggered

#### Controller Log Analysis
```
Searched patterns: "(digest|sha256|fallback|conditional.*update|image.*tag)"
Result: No digest-specific or conditional update logic detected
Sample log entries show standard ClusterCurator job creation without digest processing
```

### üî¥ Final Deployment Status Classification

**STATUS: FEATURE NOT DEPLOYED**

**Evidence:**
- ‚úÖ Annotation recognition works (controller processes the annotation)
- ‚ùå Core digest resolution logic is missing
- ‚ùå Conditional update processing not implemented  
- ‚ùå Tag fallback mechanism not present
- ‚ùå No digest-specific log messages or behavior

**Interpretation:**
The qe6 environment has the basic ClusterCurator infrastructure and annotation support, but the **ACM-22079 feature implementation is not deployed**. The controller recognizes the annotation but lacks the core digest resolution and fallback logic described in the ticket.

## Feature Overview & Business Value

### Customer Value Statement
Urgent request by Amadeus customer to use image digest for non-recommended upgrades as the image tag doesn't work in their disconnected environment. This enhancement should enable ClusterCurator to:

1. **Digest Resolution**: Automatically resolve image digests for non-recommended versions ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
2. **Disconnected Support**: Support disconnected environments where image tags may not resolve ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
3. **Fallback Mechanism**: Use image tags when digest resolution fails ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
4. **Annotation Control**: Use annotation to gate non-recommended upgrades ‚úÖ **PARTIALLY WORKING**

### Technical Context
- **Component**: ClusterCurator Controller (`cluster-curator-controller`)
- **Namespace**: `multicluster-engine`
- **Current Version**: `quay.io:443/acm-d/cluster-curator-controller-rhel9@sha256:902c5b3b4a4e8cb0a14fa5aba8451ec02830d5167ff1b91323ded62255983cd9`
- **Feature Status**: **Development incomplete or not yet deployed**

## Test Plan Validation Results

### What CAN Be Tested (Limited Scope)
‚úÖ **Annotation Validation**: Test that annotation is recognized by controller  
‚úÖ **Basic ClusterCurator Workflow**: Standard upgrade processes work  
‚úÖ **Resource Schema Validation**: ClusterCurator CRD supports required fields  
‚úÖ **Environment Readiness**: Cluster and ACM components are functional

### What CANNOT Be Tested (Core Feature Missing)
‚ùå **Digest Resolution**: Core digest lookup functionality not implemented  
‚ùå **Conditional Update Processing**: No conditional update handling  
‚ùå **Tag Fallback Behavior**: Fallback mechanism not present  
‚ùå **Non-Recommended Version Logic**: Specific gating logic not deployed  
‚ùå **Disconnected Environment Support**: Digest-based functionality unavailable

### Test Execution Recommendations

#### Immediate Testing (Limited Scope)
1. **Annotation Recognition Testing** - Verify controller processes annotation
2. **Schema Validation** - Confirm CRD supports required fields
3. **Basic Upgrade Workflow** - Test standard ClusterCurator upgrade functionality
4. **Error Handling** - Test invalid version handling

#### Future Testing (Post-Deployment)
1. **Core Digest Functionality** - All digest resolution test cases
2. **Fallback Mechanisms** - Tag-based fallback when digest unavailable  
3. **Integration Testing** - End-to-end digest-based upgrades
4. **Disconnected Environment** - Real disconnected cluster scenarios

## Implementation Status & Environment Analysis

### Current Deployment Analysis
‚úÖ **Environment Ready**: qe6-vmware-ibm cluster fully configured  
‚úÖ **ACM Components**: MultiClusterHub 2.14.0 running in `ocm` namespace  
‚úÖ **MCE Components**: MultiClusterEngine 2.9.0 available in `multicluster-engine` namespace  
‚úÖ **ClusterCurator Infrastructure**: CRD available, controller deployed and running  
‚úÖ **Managed Clusters**: Multiple test clusters available for testing  
‚ùå **Feature Implementation**: Core ACM-22079 logic not deployed

### Deployment Timeline Assessment
**Current Status**: Feature development may be complete but not deployed to qe6  
**Expected Availability**: Unknown - requires coordination with development team  
**Alternative Testing**: Limited annotation and infrastructure testing possible now  
**Full Testing Readiness**: Awaiting feature deployment to test environment

## Risk Analysis & Mitigation

### Current Risks
1. **Feature Deployment Delay**: Unknown timeline for qe6 deployment
2. **Testing Blockage**: Core functionality cannot be validated
3. **Customer Impact**: Amadeus requirement cannot be fully verified
4. **QE Timeline**: Testing schedule may need adjustment

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Limited Testing Execution**: Proceed with available test cases
2. **Development Coordination**: Engage with development team for deployment timeline
3. **Alternative Environment**: Consider testing on development/staging clusters
4. **Documentation Readiness**: Prepare comprehensive test plan for post-deployment execution

---

## Recommendations & Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Execute Limited Test Plan**: Run annotation and infrastructure tests
2. **Development Engagement**: Contact development team for deployment status
3. **Environment Investigation**: Check if feature is available in other QE environments
4. **Timeline Coordination**: Align testing schedule with feature deployment

### Development Coordination Questions
1. **When will ACM-22079 implementation be deployed to qe6?**
2. **Is the feature available in development or staging environments?**
3. **What is the expected deployment timeline for QE environments?**
4. **Are there specific build artifacts or images with the implementation?**

### Quality Assurance Impact
- **QE Schedule**: Testing timeline needs adjustment based on deployment availability
- **Test Automation**: Automation work (ACM-22081) should wait for feature deployment
- **Documentation**: Document testing can proceed with available information (ACM-22457)

## Environment Deployment Analysis

**üî¥ Feature Deployment Status: NOT AVAILABLE**

The qe6 environment has all required infrastructure components but lacks the core ACM-22079 feature implementation. Testing is limited to annotation recognition and basic ClusterCurator workflows until the digest-based upgrade logic is deployed.

**Next Steps**: Coordinate with development team to determine deployment timeline and identify environments where feature testing is possible.
