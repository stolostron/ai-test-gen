**Feature Validation**: ⚠️ **VERSION AWARE** - Feature targeted for ACM 2.15.0, test environment runs ACM 2.14.0-62 (tests generated as future-ready for environment upgrade)  
**Testing Approach**: Direct feature testing with dual UI+CLI approach, version-aware test generation, complete backward compatibility validation

## 1. JIRA Analysis Summary
**Ticket Details**: [ACM-22079: Support digest-based upgrades via ClusterCurator for non-recommended upgrades](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ACM-22079)

This critical priority ticket addresses an urgent customer request from Amadeus to enable image digest usage for non-recommended OpenShift upgrades in disconnected environments. The feature is part of epic [ACM-21980](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ACM-21980) and targets ACM 2.15.0 release.

**Key Requirements**:
- Enable ClusterCurator to use image digests instead of tags for non-recommended upgrades
- Support disconnected/air-gapped environments where image tags are insufficient
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing upgrade workflows
- Include comprehensive testing, security assessment, and documentation [ACM-22457](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ACM-22457)

**Business Value**: This addresses a blocking issue for enterprise customers operating in restricted network environments who require non-recommended upgrade paths using digest-based image references.

## 2. Environment Assessment
**Test Environment Health**: 9.2/10 (Excellent - Above 7.0 threshold)  
**Cluster Details**: [mist10-0.qe.red-chesterfield.com Console](https://console-openshift-console.apps.mist10-0.qe.red-chesterfield.com)

**Infrastructure Readiness**:
- ✅ **Console Connectivity**: OpenShift 4.20.0-ec.4 accessible
- ✅ **ACM Deployment**: MultiClusterHub 2.14.0-62 Running in ocm namespace
- ✅ **MCE Deployment**: MultiClusterEngine 2.9.0-212 Available
- ✅ **ClusterCurator**: CRD v1beta1 installed, controller running (2/2 pods)
- ✅ **Managed Clusters**: local-cluster available and healthy
- ✅ **Authentication**: Successfully authenticated with provided credentials
- ✅ **Project Access**: 160 projects accessible

**Version Context**: Feature targets ACM 2.15.0 while test environment runs ACM 2.14.0-62. Test plan generated with version awareness for future environment compatibility.

## 3. Implementation Analysis
**Primary Implementation**: [GitHub stolostron/cluster-curator-controller PR #468](https://github.com/stolostron/cluster-curator-controller/pull/468)

**Technical Implementation Details**:
- **Algorithm**: 3-tier image lookup strategy (conditionalUpdates → availableUpdates → image tag fallback)
- **Files Modified**: curator.go, hive.go, hive_test.go, helpers.go
- **New Function**: `GetImageDigestFromClusterVersion` in pkg/jobs/utils/helpers.go
- **Test Coverage**: 81.2% on new code with comprehensive unit tests
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained through intelligent fallback mechanisms

**Code Changes Summary**:
- Added digest lookup functionality checking ClusterVersion conditionalUpdates list
- Implemented fallback to availableUpdates if digest not found in conditionalUpdates
- Maintained image tag fallback for complete backward compatibility
- Restored LoadConfig() function for local testing capabilities

**Integration Points**:
- ClusterCurator spec annotation: `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/upgrade-allow-not-recommended-versions: 'true'`
- Integration with OpenShift ClusterVersion conditionalUpdates and availableUpdates APIs
- Enhanced hive job processing with digest resolution logic

## 4. Test Scenarios Analysis
**Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive feature validation with version awareness and backward compatibility focus

### Test Case 1: Validate ClusterCurator digest-based non-recommended upgrade workflow
**Scenario**: Complete end-to-end validation of digest-based upgrade functionality  
**Purpose**: Verifies that ClusterCurator can successfully perform upgrades using image digests when the non-recommended annotation is enabled  
**Critical Validation**: Digest lookup from conditionalUpdates, proper annotation handling, complete upgrade workflow execution  
**Customer Value**: Directly addresses Amadeus customer requirement for disconnected environment upgrades

### Test Case 2: Verify ClusterCurator image lookup fallback strategy and error handling  
**Scenario**: Comprehensive testing of the 3-tier fallback algorithm  
**Purpose**: Validates fallback behavior when digest lookup fails in conditionalUpdates and falls back to availableUpdates then image tag  
**Critical Validation**: Proper error handling, graceful degradation, backward compatibility maintenance  
**Customer Value**: Ensures robust upgrade functionality across different cluster configurations and version availability scenarios

### Test Case 3: Test ClusterCurator backward compatibility with standard upgrade workflows
**Scenario**: Side-by-side comparison of digest-enabled vs standard upgrade workflows  
**Purpose**: Confirms existing ClusterCurator functionality remains unaffected when digest feature is available but not activated  
**Critical Validation**: No regression in standard functionality, consistent behavior for existing workflows  
**Customer Value**: Protects existing customer investments while enabling new digest-based capabilities

**Comprehensive Coverage Rationale**: These three test scenarios provide complete coverage of the digest-based upgrade feature by testing the primary workflow (Test Case 1), fallback mechanisms (Test Case 2), and compatibility assurance (Test Case 3). This approach ensures both the new functionality works correctly and existing customer workflows remain unaffected, meeting the critical business requirement for enterprise customer support in disconnected environments.
