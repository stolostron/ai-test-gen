## Test Case 1: ConditionalUpdates Digest Discovery Success Path

**Description:**
Validate the primary digest discovery mechanism through ClusterCurator's conditionalUpdates API query. This test ensures the annotation-controlled feature enables digest-based upgrades for non-recommended versions in disconnected environments, addressing Amadeus customer requirements for reliable cluster lifecycle management.

**Setup:**
- Create managed cluster with available conditionalUpdates containing target version
- Configure ClusterCurator with annotation: `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/upgrade-allow-not-recommended-versions: 'true'`  
- Ensure target cluster has conditionalUpdates API accessible
- Verify ManagedClusterView connectivity for remote resource queries

**Test Steps:**

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **Step 1: Log into the ACM hub cluster** | `oc login <CLUSTER_CONSOLE_URL> -u <CLUSTER_ADMIN_USER> -p <CLUSTER_ADMIN_PASSWORD>` | Authentication successful, hub cluster access confirmed |
| **Step 2: Create ClusterCurator resource** | `oc apply -f clustercurator-digest-upgrade.yaml` | ClusterCurator created with digest annotation enabled |
| **Step 3: Verify conditionalUpdates availability** | `oc get managedclusterview clusterversion-view -o yaml` | ConditionalUpdates array contains target version 4.15.0 |
| **Step 4: Monitor digest discovery process** | `oc logs deployment/cluster-curator-controller -f` | Log shows "Found conditional update image digest" message |
| **Step 5: Validate ClusterVersion update** | `oc get managedclusteraction upgrade-action -o yaml` | DesiredUpdate contains digest format `@sha256:abc123...` |
| **Step 6: Monitor upgrade progress** | `oc get clustercurator amadeus-upgrade -o yaml` | Status shows upgrade in progress with digest-based image |
| **Step 7: Verify upgrade completion** | `oc get managedclusterview clusterversion-view -o yaml` | Cluster version updated to 4.15.0 with digest confirmation |

**Sample Outputs:**
```yaml
# ClusterCurator status showing successful digest discovery
status:
  conditions:
  - type: ClusterCuratorJobMonitor
    status: "True"
    message: "Using image digest from conditionalUpdates: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release@sha256:abc123..."
```

**Expected Results:**
- ClusterCurator successfully discovers image digest from conditionalUpdates API
- ManagedClusterAction created with digest-based desiredUpdate specification
- Target cluster upgrades to version 4.15.0 using image digest (not tag)
- Complete audit trail generated for compliance requirements

|------|--------|----------------|
| **Step 1: Log into the ACM hub cluster** | `oc login <CLUSTER_CONSOLE_URL> -u <CLUSTER_ADMIN_USER> -p <CLUSTER_ADMIN_PASSWORD>` | Successful authentication with administrative access |
| **Step 2: Simulate conditionalUpdates unavailability** | `oc patch managedclusterview clusterversion-view --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"scope":{"resource":"clusterversions","apiVersion":"config.openshift.io/v1"}}}'` | ConditionalUpdates removed from ClusterVersion status |
| **Step 3: Create ClusterCurator with fallback configuration** | `oc apply -f clustercurator-fallback-test.yaml` | ClusterCurator created with enhanced retry configuration |
| **Step 4: Monitor fallback algorithm execution** | `oc logs deployment/cluster-curator-controller -f` | Logs show "Check for image digest in available updates just in case" |
| **Step 5: Verify availableUpdates discovery** | `oc get managedclusteraction upgrade-fallback -o yaml` | Action shows digest discovered from availableUpdates array |
| **Step 6: Validate graceful degradation** | `oc describe clustercurator amadeus-fallback` | Events show successful tier 2 fallback without errors |
| **Step 7: Confirm upgrade execution** | `oc get managedclusterview clusterversion-status -o yaml` | Upgrade proceeds using availableUpdates digest information |

**Sample Outputs:**
```yaml
# Controller logs showing fallback mechanism
2025-08-25T14:05:00Z INFO Found available update image digest
2025-08-25T14:05:00Z INFO Proceeding with tier 2 fallback mechanism
2025-08-25T14:05:00Z INFO Using image: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release@sha256:def456...
```

**Expected Results:**
