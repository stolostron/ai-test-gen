## 1. JIRA Analysis Summary

**Ticket Details**: [ACM-1745: Implement upgrade modal for AWS HyperShift clusters](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ACM-1745)

**Feature Requirements**: Implementation of a dedicated upgrade modal for AWS HyperShift clusters that supports separate upgrade paths for control planes and node pools. The feature addresses the unique architecture of HyperShift where control planes and worker nodes can be upgraded independently.

**Business Context**: HyperShift represents a significant shift in OpenShift cluster architecture by decoupling control planes from data planes. This upgrade modal provides users with granular control over cluster component upgrades, enabling more flexible maintenance windows and reducing upgrade-related downtime.

**Implementation Scope**: The modal interface integrates into the existing ACM console cluster management workflow, providing intuitive access to upgrade functionality while maintaining the separation of concerns between hosted control planes and their associated node pools.

**Priority Assessment**: Major priority ticket with QE-Confidence:Green rating, indicating successful quality validation and customer readiness.

## 2. Environment Assessment

**Test Environment Health**: 9.2/10 (Excellent)  
**Cluster Details**: [mist10-0.qe.red-chesterfield.com](https://console-openshift-console.apps.mist10-0.qe.red-chesterfield.com)

**Infrastructure Status**: The test environment demonstrates excellent health with 25-day uptime, ACM 2.14.0-62 operational status, and comprehensive HyperShift operator deployment. All prerequisite components including multicluster engine (2.9.0-212) and HyperShift CRDs are properly installed and functional.

**HyperShift Readiness**: Environment includes full HyperShift operator stack with all required Custom Resource Definitions (hostedclusters.hypershift.openshift.io, nodepools.hypershift.openshift.io, etc.) and active operator deployments across hypershift and multicluster-engine namespaces.

**Version Compatibility**: Test environment ACM version (2.14.0-62) significantly exceeds the feature implementation version (ACM 2.7.0), ensuring full feature availability and compatibility for comprehensive testing.

## 3. Implementation Analysis

**Primary Implementation**: [GitHub PR #2229: Hypershift upgrade modal](https://github.com/stolostron/console/pull/2229)

**Technical Architecture**: The implementation introduces a comprehensive 775-line HypershiftUpgradeModal.tsx component with complete TypeScript implementation. The modal integrates into the existing cluster management workflow through ClusterActionDropdown.tsx and DistributionField.tsx components.

**Key Implementation Features**:
- **Dual Upgrade Paths**: Separate control plane and node pool upgrade capabilities with independent version selection
- **UI Integration**: Seamless integration into existing ACM console cluster management interface
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 1,501-line test suite (HypershiftUpgradeModal.test.tsx) ensuring functional validation
- **Accessibility Enhancements**: AcmExpandableCheckbox component integration for improved user experience

**Recent Updates**: Implementation includes recent constraint validation (ACM-19723) that prevents upgrade attempts on managed HCP clusters (ROSA HCP imported to ACM), addressing edge cases where HostedCluster resources are not present on the hub.

**Quality Assurance**: SonarCloud validation shows 80.6% code coverage with 0 bugs, 0 vulnerabilities, and minimal code smells, indicating high-quality implementation ready for production use.

## 4. Test Scenarios Analysis

**Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive E2E validation focusing on modal accessibility, upgrade workflow functionality, and constraint enforcement

### Test Case 1: Validate HyperShift Upgrade Modal Access and Availability
**Scenario**: Verify modal accessibility from ACM console cluster management interface  
**Purpose**: Ensure users can successfully access the upgrade modal through standard cluster management workflows  
**Critical Validation**: Modal opens correctly with proper display of control plane and node pool upgrade options  
**Customer Value**: Validates the primary user entry point for HyperShift cluster upgrade management

### Test Case 2: Test HyperShift Control Plane Upgrade Workflow  
**Scenario**: Validate control plane upgrade functionality within the modal interface  
**Purpose**: Ensure control plane upgrades can be initiated and tracked through the UI workflow  
**Critical Validation**: Version selection, upgrade initiation, and progress monitoring work as expected  
**Customer Value**: Confirms core functionality for hosted control plane lifecycle management

### Test Case 3: Verify HyperShift Node Pool Upgrade Process
**Scenario**: Test independent node pool upgrade capabilities separate from control plane operations  
**Purpose**: Validate the architectural separation between control plane and data plane upgrade operations  
**Critical Validation**: Node pool selection, version targeting, and upgrade configuration function properly  
**Customer Value**: Enables flexible maintenance scheduling with minimal service disruption

### Test Case 4: Validate Managed HCP Cluster Upgrade Restrictions
**Scenario**: Verify enforcement of upgrade restrictions for managed HCP clusters (ROSA HCP)  
**Purpose**: Ensure recent constraint implementation (ACM-19723) properly prevents invalid upgrade attempts  
**Critical Validation**: Appropriate error handling and user messaging for restricted operations  
**Customer Value**: Prevents user confusion and potential system issues from unsupported operations

**Comprehensive Coverage Rationale**: These test scenarios provide complete validation of the upgrade modal functionality, covering both positive workflows (successful upgrades) and constraint validation (restricted scenarios). The testing approach ensures all customer-facing functionality works as designed while validating recent security and constraint enhancements.
