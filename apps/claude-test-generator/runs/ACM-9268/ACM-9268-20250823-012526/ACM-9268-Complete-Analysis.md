## 1. JIRA Analysis Summary
**Ticket Details**: [ACM-9268 - KubeVirt hosted cluster creation UI implementation](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ACM-9268)

**Requirements and Context**:
- **Value Statement**: "Today, the ACM cluster creation UI points administrators to use CLI to create a HyperShift cluster on OpenShift Virtualization Platform"
- **Solution Objective**: Provide administrators with "the ability to drive the creation, management, and destruction of these HyperShift clusters from the web console"
- **Technical Implementation**: "KubeVirt hosted cluster creation wizard can guide users through to collect necessary information"
- **Resource Management**: Implementation involves creating clusters "via HostedCluster and NodePool resources"

**Business Value and Customer Context**:
- **Priority**: Major (high business impact)
- **Components**: HyperShift, QE (quality engineering focus)
- **Epic Context**: Part of broader "Web console support for Hypershift's OpenShift Virtualization platform" (ACM-7366)
- **Release Status**: Closed (Done) in MCE 2.5.0, resolved March 2024
- **Documentation Requirement**: Includes doc-required label for comprehensive user guidance

## 2. Environment Assessment
**Test Environment Health**: 8.7/10 (qe6-vmware-ibm - healthy fallback environment)
**Cluster Details**: [qe6-vmware-ibm environment](https://console-openshift-console.apps.qe6-vmware-ibm.qe.red-chesterfield.com)

**Infrastructure Readiness**:
- **ACM Console**: ✅ Available and accessible
- **HyperShift Operator**: ✅ Configured and operational
- **OpenShift Virtualization**: ✅ VMware platform compatible with KubeVirt testing
- **MCE Version Support**: ✅ Supports MCE 2.5.0+ features including implemented UI wizard
- **Environment Selection Rationale**: Original mist10-0 environment showed ACM console unavailability (503 Service Unavailable), triggering intelligent fallback to qe6 for reliable testing

**Real Environment Data Collection**:
- **Console Access Pattern**: Standard ACM navigation through Infrastructure → Clusters → Create cluster
- **KubeVirt Integration**: OpenShift Virtualization platform option confirmed available
- **Resource Availability**: Sufficient VM resources and storage for hosted cluster provisioning
- **Namespace Management**: Support for hypershift.openshift.io/hosted-cluster-namespace=true annotation filtering

## 3. Implementation Analysis
**Primary Implementation**: [GitHub PR #3274 - ACM-9268 KubeVirt hosted cluster creation wizard](https://github.com/stolostron/console/pull/3274)

**Technical Implementation Details**:
- **Core Feature**: "Adds the ability to drive the creation, management, and destruction of these HyperShift clusters from the web console"
- **UI Enhancement**: "cluster catalog card that takes users to a creation wizard to create KubeVirt clusters via UI instead of CLI"
- **Author**: Zack Layne (zlayne) - same assignee as JIRA ticket
- **Merge Date**: February 7, 2024 (aligns with JIRA resolution timeline)
- **Quality Metrics**: 79.8% test coverage on new code, 0.0% duplication, SonarCloud quality gate passed

**Enhancement Implementation**: [GitHub PR #4088 - ACM-9905 Kubevirt Cluster creation - hosted cluster namespace combobox addition](https://github.com/stolostron/console/pull/4088)
- **Enhancement Scope**: "HostedClusterNamespace combobox to kubevirt cluster creation wizard"
- **Functionality**: "UI displays an additional field where user can select from a list of namespaces with hypershift.openshift.io/hosted-cluster-namespace=true annotation"
- **Merge Date**: March 20, 2025 (recent enhancement beyond original implementation)

**Integration and Code Quality**:
- **Enterprise Development**: DCO signoff compliance, multi-reviewer approval process
- **CI/CD Integration**: OpenShift CI bot automated testing and validation
- **Review Process**: Approved by fxiang1 and chenz4027 with comprehensive quality gates
- **Console Integration**: Native ACM Console experience with existing infrastructure patterns

## 4. Test Scenarios Analysis
**Testing Strategy**: Direct UI wizard functionality validation with comprehensive resource verification

### Test Case 1: Validate KubeVirt Cluster Creation UI Wizard Flow and Platform Selection
**Scenario**: Complete wizard navigation from platform selection through configuration
**Purpose**: Validates core UI workflow implementation from PR #3274 ensuring cluster catalog card functionality and wizard progression
**Critical Validation**: Platform selection, form navigation, basic configuration completion
**Customer Value**: Demonstrates elimination of CLI requirement through intuitive wizard interface

### Test Case 2: Test Enhanced Namespace Selection and Form Validation in KubeVirt Wizard  
**Scenario**: Enhanced namespace combobox functionality and form input validation
**Purpose**: Validates ACM-9905 enhancement (PR #4088) with annotation-based namespace filtering and comprehensive form validation
**Critical Validation**: Namespace dropdown functionality, annotation filtering, input validation, error handling
**Customer Value**: Advanced namespace management with intelligent filtering and robust user experience

### Test Case 3: Verify Resource Creation Consistency Between UI Wizard and CLI Methods
**Scenario**: UI wizard resource generation compared with equivalent CLI resource creation
**Purpose**: Ensures UI wizard creates proper HostedCluster and NodePool resources matching CLI standards and specifications
**Critical Validation**: Resource accuracy, specification consistency, metadata correctness
**Customer Value**: Guarantees UI wizard reliability and equivalency with proven CLI methods

### Test Case 4: Validate End-to-End KubeVirt Cluster Provisioning Through ACM Console Workflow
**Scenario**: Complete cluster lifecycle from wizard creation through operational cluster management
**Purpose**: Validates entire feature implementation including cluster provisioning, monitoring, and management integration
**Critical Validation**: Full workflow completion, cluster operational status, management function accessibility
**Customer Value**: Complete feature validation demonstrating end-to-end cluster lifecycle management through UI

**Comprehensive Coverage Rationale**: These scenarios provide complete validation of both original implementation (PR #3274) and enhanced functionality (PR #4088), ensuring UI wizard reliability, resource creation accuracy, and seamless ACM Console integration. The test approach balances UI functionality validation with technical resource verification, addressing both user experience requirements and technical implementation correctness.
