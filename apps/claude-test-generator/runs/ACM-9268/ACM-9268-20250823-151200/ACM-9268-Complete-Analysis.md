## 1. JIRA Analysis Summary
**Ticket Details**: [ACM-9268: KubeVirt hosted cluster creation UI implementation](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ACM-9268)

**Business Requirements**: Today's ACM cluster creation UI forces administrators to use CLI for HyperShift cluster creation on OpenShift Virtualization Platform, creating a disjointed experience since cluster management is available through the web console post-creation. The feature delivers integrated web console capability for creation, management, and destruction of HyperShift clusters.

**Definition of Done**: KubeVirt hosted cluster creation wizard guides users through collecting necessary information to create hosted clusters via HostedCluster and NodePool resources with complete UI workflow implementation.

**Epic Context**: [ACM-7366](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ACM-7366) provides the broader HyperShift integration framework within ACM.

**Dependencies**: 
- [OCPBUGS-28601: webhook release payload validation introduces resource ordering error](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-28601) - Infrastructure dependency resolved
- [ACM-9850: Document UI option to create a KubeVirt hosted cluster creation](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ACM-9850) - Documentation coverage

**Components**: HyperShift, QE with UI implementation focus and comprehensive testing requirements.

## 2. Environment Assessment

  - hypershift-addon-agent: hypershift-addon-agent-58d5cf9b75-7prz4 (2/2 containers)

**Virtualization Capabilities**: Comprehensive VMX support detected with extensive CPU feature labels including vmx-ept, vmx-vpid, and full hypervisor capabilities on worker nodes. Multiple CPU models supported (Cascadelake-Server, Broadwell, Haswell, etc.) ensuring robust virtualization foundation.

**Storage Infrastructure**: 
- **Default**: ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd
- **Virtualization-Optimized**: ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd-virtualization (specifically for KubeVirt workloads)
- **File Storage**: ocs-storagecluster-cephfs
- **Object Storage**: ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rgw, openshift-storage.noobaa.io

**Managed Cluster Status**: local-cluster (HUB ACCEPTED: true, JOINED: True, AVAILABLE: True) confirming healthy ACM cluster management infrastructure.

## 3. Implementation Analysis
**Primary Implementation**: [stolostron/console#3274: ACM-9268 KubeVirt hosted cluster creation wizard](https://github.com/stolostron/console/pull/3274)

**Core Changes**: Merged February 7, 2024 - Adds ability to drive creation, management, and destruction of HyperShift clusters from web console. Implementation includes cluster catalog card that directs users to creation wizard for KubeVirt clusters via UI instead of CLI-only approach.

**Recent Enhancements**:
- [stolostron/console#4088: ACM-9905 Kubevirt Cluster creation - hosted cluster namespace combobox addition](https://github.com/stolostron/console/pull/4088) - Merged November 22, 2024: Adds hosted cluster namespace field with clusters as default value and user-defined namespace support
- [stolostron/console#4123: ACM-15840 Validate hosted cluster namespace for HCP on KubeVirt wizard](https://github.com/stolostron/console/pull/4123) - Merged December 12, 2024: Enhanced validation preventing namespace conflicts with managed clusters

**Technical Architecture**: UI wizard workflow creates HostedCluster and NodePool resources with KubeVirt platform type. Integration leverages HyperShift operator for cluster provisioning and ACM for ongoing management. Namespace validation prevents conflicts with existing managed clusters.

**QE Repository Analysis**: stolostron/clc-ui-e2e contains existing test patterns including virtualizationCreateClusterDetails.spec.js for UI validation and createHyperShiftCluster.spec.js for Infrastructure Environment-based creation. KubeVirt HyperShift templates provide complete resource specifications for testing scenarios.

## 4. Test Scenarios Analysis
**Testing Strategy**: End-to-end UI workflow validation with comprehensive resource verification and cluster management integration

### Test Case 1: KubeVirt Hosted Cluster Creation via ACM Console UI Wizard
**Scenario**: Complete wizard workflow from cluster creation initiation through deployment completion  
**Purpose**: Validates the core business value delivery - replacing CLI-only workflow with integrated Console experience  
**Critical Validation**: UI navigation (Infrastructure → Clusters → Create → KubeVirt → Hosted), configuration form completion, resource creation confirmation  
**Customer Value**: Direct validation of the primary user story - administrators can create HyperShift clusters through web console

### Test Case 2: KubeVirt Hosted Cluster Configuration Validation and Error Handling  
**Scenario**: Form validation logic, namespace conflict detection, and error recovery workflows  
**Purpose**: Ensures robust user experience through comprehensive validation and error handling  
**Critical Validation**: Namespace conflict detection (cluster name vs namespace, existing managed cluster conflicts), resource constraint validation, invalid configuration handling  
**Customer Value**: Prevents configuration errors and provides clear guidance for successful cluster creation

### Test Case 3: KubeVirt Hosted Cluster Resource Verification and Management Integration
**Scenario**: Post-creation resource verification and cluster lifecycle management capabilities  
**Purpose**: Validates end-to-end integration from creation through ongoing management  
**Critical Validation**: HostedCluster and NodePool resource creation, ManagedCluster import, cluster lifecycle operations access  
**Customer Value**: Confirms complete integration promise - consistent creation and management experience through ACM Console

**Comprehensive Coverage Rationale**: These three scenarios provide complete validation of the ACM-9268 feature implementation by testing the core workflow (Test Case 1), validation robustness (Test Case 2), and integration completeness (Test Case 3). Together they ensure the feature delivers on its promise to replace the disjoint CLI experience with seamless web console integration for HyperShift cluster lifecycle management on OpenShift Virtualization Platform.
