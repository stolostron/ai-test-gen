## 4. Test Scenarios Analysis
**Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive KubeVirt hosted cluster lifecycle testing covering creation wizard validation, VM infrastructure deployment, platform integration, and virtual machine orchestration across complete cluster management workflows

### Test Case 1: KubeVirt Hosted Cluster Creation Wizard Access and Platform Selection
**Scenario**: Validate cluster creation wizard accessibility and KubeVirt platform selection functionality through integrated interface
**Purpose**: Ensure wizard correctly provides KubeVirt platform option with proper configuration capabilities and resource specification
**Critical Validation**: Platform selection functionality, wizard navigation, resource configuration interface, VM specification capabilities
**Customer Value**: Provides streamlined cluster creation experience eliminating CLI dependency and enabling seamless virtual machine-based deployment

### Test Case 2: KubeVirt Hosted Cluster VM Infrastructure Validation
**Scenario**: Test virtual machine infrastructure deployment and resource allocation through cluster management interface
**Purpose**: Validate wizard's capability to deploy VM infrastructure with proper resource allocation and monitoring capabilities
**Critical Validation**: VM deployment functionality, resource allocation accuracy, storage integration, network connectivity validation
**Customer Value**: Ensures reliable virtual machine infrastructure deployment with comprehensive resource management and monitoring

### Test Case 3: KubeVirt Hosted Cluster Management and Operations
**Scenario**: Verify cluster management operations including scaling, monitoring, and lifecycle management through VM orchestration
**Purpose**: Ensure comprehensive cluster lifecycle management through virtual machine orchestration with proper operational capabilities
**Critical Validation**: Scaling operations, resource monitoring, maintenance procedures, upgrade capabilities, deletion cleanup
