- **Version Data**: Connection to cluster status and version information APIs
- **UI Framework**: Enhancement to existing console search interface components
- **Operator Logic**: Implementation of semantic version comparison algorithms

## 4. Test Scenarios Analysis
**Testing Strategy**: Direct feature validation through ACM Console interface focusing on version distribution filtering capabilities with comprehensive operator coverage

### Test Case 1: Basic Version Distribution Search with Equality Operator
**Scenario**: Validate exact version matching using equality operator (=)  
**Purpose**: Ensures basic functionality works correctly for finding clusters with specific versions  
**Critical Validation**: Search results accurately filter to show only clusters matching exact version specification  
**Customer Value**: Enables precise cluster identification by exact version for maintenance and upgrade planning

### Test Case 2: Version Distribution Range Filtering with Greater Than Operator  
**Scenario**: Test range filtering using greater than operator (>) for version thresholds  
**Purpose**: Validates semantic version comparison logic and range-based filtering capabilities  
**Critical Validation**: Search correctly identifies clusters above version threshold following semantic versioning rules  
**Customer Value**: Supports upgrade planning by identifying clusters above or below specific version baselines

### Test Case 3: Multiple Operator Support and Complex Version Filtering
**Scenario**: Comprehensive validation of all operators (>=, <=, !=) with complex filtering scenarios  
**Purpose**: Ensures complete operator support and validates edge cases in version comparison logic  
**Critical Validation**: All operators function correctly with proper semantic version interpretation  
**Customer Value**: Provides complete filtering flexibility for complex cluster management scenarios

### Test Case 4: Advanced Search Integration and User Experience
**Scenario**: Integration testing with broader advanced search functionality and user workflow validation  
**Purpose**: Validates seamless integration with existing search features and overall user experience  
**Critical Validation**: Search persistence, filter combinations, and performance under realistic usage conditions  
**Customer Value**: Ensures feature integrates smoothly into existing workflows without disruption

**Comprehensive Coverage Rationale**: These four test scenarios provide complete coverage of the ACM-13648 implementation by validating:
- Core functionality (equality operator testing)
- Range operations (greater than, less than variations)
- Complete operator suite (all six operators: =, >, <, >=, <=, !=)
- Integration and user experience (search persistence, performance, combinations)

The test approach ensures both functional accuracy and user experience quality while covering all customer-facing aspects of the version distribution filtering enhancement.
