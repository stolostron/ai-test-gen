## 4. Test Scenarios Analysis
**Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive RBAC admin role security testing covering role assignment, permission validation, access control enforcement, and multi-user environment integration across complete security management lifecycle

### Test Case 1: RBAC Admin Role Assignment and Permission Validation
**Scenario**: Validate admin role assignment functionality and comprehensive permission validation for administrative access control
**Purpose**: Ensure proper admin role configuration with comprehensive permission validation and access control capabilities
**Critical Validation**: Role assignment functionality, permission validation, access control verification, administrative capabilities
**Customer Value**: Provides reliable administrative access control ensuring proper security management and comprehensive permission validation

### Test Case 2: RBAC Admin Role Security Validation and Access Control
**Scenario**: Validate admin role security controls, permission boundaries, and access restriction functionality
**Purpose**: Ensure comprehensive security validation with proper access boundaries and permission enforcement
**Critical Validation**: Security controls, permission boundaries, access restrictions, policy enforcement
**Customer Value**: Ensures robust security posture with comprehensive access control and permission boundary enforcement

### Test Case 3: RBAC Admin Role Integration and Multi-User Validation
**Scenario**: Validate admin role integration with multi-user environments and comprehensive role management scenarios
**Purpose**: Ensure seamless multi-user integration with proper role hierarchy and permission inheritance
