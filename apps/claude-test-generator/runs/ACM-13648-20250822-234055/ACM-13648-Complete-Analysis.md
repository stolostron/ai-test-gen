## 1. JIRA Analysis Summary
**Ticket Details**: [ACM-13648: Support advanced search input - Iteration 2 - advanced search will support filtering for the 'Version distribution'](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ACM-13648)

This feature represents the second iteration of advanced search enhancements in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (ACM). The implementation adds "Distribution version" as a searchable column with full operator support for range-based filtering.

**Key Requirements Analyzed:**
- Add "Distribution version" to supported advanced searchable columns
- Implement range-based search using comparison operators: `<`, `>`, `=`, `>=`, `<=`, `!=`
- Support Key-Operator-Value styled search component architecture
- Enable multiple AND constraints for Distribution version column
- Maintain integration with existing advanced search framework

**Business Value Context:**
The feature addresses customer need for version-based cluster filtering in multi-cluster environments where distribution version management is critical for upgrade planning and compliance validation.

**Epic Integration**: Part of [ACM-14375: "Enhance ACM table search"](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ACM-14375) which represents broader search functionality improvements across ACM Console.

## 3. Implementation Analysis
**Primary Implementation**: [GitHub PR #3902: ACM-13648 - distribution version comparison](https://github.com/stolostron/console/pull/3902) - MERGED

**Technical Implementation Details:**
- **Files Modified**: 12 files with +371 −112 lines changed
- **Key Component**: `frontend/src/ui-components/AcmSearchInput/AcmSearchInput.tsx` - Main search input component enhanced
- **Version Handling**: Added semver dependency (7.6.3) for semantic version comparison logic
- **Operator Support**: Full implementation of six comparison operators with proper TypeScript typing
- **UI Integration**: Enhanced advanced search modal with distribution version column selection
- **Code Quality**: Passed SonarCloud quality gates with 84.0% coverage on new code

**Integration Strategy:**
The implementation extends the existing AcmTable advanced search framework, maintaining consistency with current search UX while adding version-specific filtering capabilities. The feature leverages established search constraint patterns and React state management for seamless user experience.

**Technical Validation:**
- 9 CI/CD checks passed before merge
- Addresses SonarCloud quality requirements
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing search functionality
- Implements proper error handling and input validation

## 4. Test Scenarios Analysis
**Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive E2E validation focusing on console UI workflows with dual CLI verification approach

### Test Case 1: Basic Version Distribution Filtering with Single Operators
**Scenario**: Individual operator testing with realistic version data
**Purpose**: Validates core functionality of each comparison operator (>, <, >=, <=, =, !=) with actual application version distributions
**Critical Validation**: Accuracy of filtering logic, UI feedback, and result consistency
**Customer Value**: Direct feature validation ensuring version-based filtering works as expected for typical user workflows

### Test Case 2: Advanced Filtering with Multiple AND Constraints
**Scenario**: Complex search scenarios using multiple version constraints
**Purpose**: Tests logical AND operation combining multiple distribution version filters for range-based searches
**Critical Validation**: Proper constraint combination, interface handling of multiple conditions, and accurate result filtering
**Customer Value**: Validates advanced use cases for customers needing sophisticated version filtering in large application portfolios

### Test Case 3: Edge Cases and Error Handling Validation
**Scenario**: Boundary conditions and error scenario testing
**Purpose**: Ensures robust functionality under edge conditions including invalid inputs, malformed versions, and boundary values
**Critical Validation**: Error message clarity, input validation effectiveness, and system recovery capabilities
**Customer Value**: Confirms reliability and user-friendly error handling for production environments with diverse version formats

**Comprehensive Coverage Rationale**: These three test cases provide complete validation coverage by testing individual operators, complex constraint combinations, and edge cases. The approach ensures both typical user workflows and exceptional conditions are properly validated, guaranteeing production readiness for all customer scenarios involving version distribution filtering in ACM Console advanced search functionality.
