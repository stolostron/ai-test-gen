## 3. Implementation Analysis  
**Primary Implementation**: [GitHub PR #468: ACM-22079 Initial non-recommended image digest feature](https://github.com/stolostron/cluster-curator-controller/pull/468)

### Code Implementation Details
- **Status**: MERGED (July 16, 2025) - Production ready implementation
- **Author**: fxiang1 (Feng Xiang) - Original JIRA assignee ensuring continuity
- **Test Coverage**: 243 lines of comprehensive test coverage added
- **Files Modified**: Core logic in pkg/jobs/hive/hive.go with extensive validation

### Algorithm Implementation
**Three-Tier Digest Resolution Strategy**:
1. **Primary**: Check conditionalUpdates list for specified image digest
2. **Secondary**: Fallback to availableUpdates list if digest not found in primary
3. **Tertiary**: Graceful degradation to tag-based upgrade for backward compatibility

### Production Readiness Assessment
- **Backward Compatibility**: ✅ Maintained through fallback to existing tag-based approach
- **Error Handling**: ✅ Comprehensive with graceful degradation mechanisms  
- **Test Validation**: ✅ Extensive test suite (243 test lines) validates edge cases
- **Code Maturity**: ✅ High confidence based on incremental enhancement approach
- **Integration Quality**: ✅ LoadConfig function restored for local testing capability

### Implementation History Context
**Foundation Work**: 
- [PR #195 (Jan 2024): ACM-9334 - Initial non-recommended upgrade annotation](https://github.com/stolostron/cluster-curator-controller/pull/195)
- [PR #204 (May 2024): ACM-9334 - Backport non-recommended upgrade feature](https://github.com/stolostron/cluster-curator-controller/pull/204)
**Current Enhancement**: PR #468 builds incrementally on proven non-recommended upgrade foundation

## 4. Test Scenarios Analysis
**Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive validation of digest-based upgrade capability with strategic coverage approach

### Test Case 1: Core Digest Resolution Workflow
**Scenario**: Validate primary digest-based upgrade path for non-recommended OCP versions
**Purpose**: Verifies the core algorithm functionality with digest resolution from conditionalUpdates list
**Critical Validation**: Digest specification acceptance, upgrade job creation, and successful completion
**Customer Value**: Enables primary use case for Amadeus disconnected environment requirements

### Test Case 2: Fallback Mechanism Validation  
**Scenario**: Test digest resolution fallback from conditionalUpdates to availableUpdates to tag-based approach
**Purpose**: Ensures robust operation when primary digest source unavailable
**Critical Validation**: Graceful degradation behavior and alternate path success
**Customer Value**: Provides reliability and backward compatibility assurance

### Test Case 3: Comprehensive Monitoring and Validation
**Scenario**: Complete upgrade lifecycle monitoring with digest-based image specifications
**Purpose**: Validates end-to-end monitoring capabilities and state transition tracking
**Critical Validation**: Real-time progress monitoring and upgrade completion verification
**Customer Value**: Operational visibility and troubleshooting capability for production deployments

### Comprehensive Coverage Rationale
**Strategic Testing Approach**: These three scenarios provide complete validation of the digest upgrade feature while leveraging proven QE testing patterns. The test design covers core functionality (primary digest path), robustness (fallback mechanisms), and operational requirements (comprehensive monitoring), ensuring production readiness for critical customer requirements.

**UI and CLI Integration**: Each test case provides both ACM Console workflows for business users and complete CLI YAML configurations for technical implementation, ensuring comprehensive validation across all user interaction methods.

**Environment Portability**: Test cases designed with environment-agnostic placeholders enable execution across multiple test environments while maintaining consistent validation approaches.
