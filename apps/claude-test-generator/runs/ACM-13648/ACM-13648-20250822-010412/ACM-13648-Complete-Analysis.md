## 1. JIRA Analysis Summary
**Ticket Details**: [ACM-13648: Support advanced search input - Iteration 2 - advanced search will support filtering for the "Version distribution"](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ACM-13648)

This feature represents the second iteration of ACM Console advanced search functionality, specifically adding semantic version comparison capabilities for distribution version filtering. Building on the foundation established in ACM-13644, this implementation introduces comprehensive operator support for version-based cluster filtering with intelligent range detection and multiple constraint handling.

**Key Requirements**:
- Distribution version column integration with advanced search framework established in Iteration 1
- Comprehensive operator support including >, <, >=, <=, != and = for semantic version comparison
- Range-based search functionality using semantic versioning standards and intelligent inference
- Multiple AND constraint support enabling complex version range filtering scenarios
- Semantic version parsing with automatic coercion and intelligent partial version handling

**Business Value**: Dramatically improves cluster management efficiency for administrators managing diverse cluster environments with multiple OpenShift/Kubernetes versions, enabling rapid identification of clusters requiring upgrades, maintenance, or compatibility validation.

## 2. Environment Assessment
**Test Environment Health**: Score 8.7/10 - Healthy
**Cluster Details**: [qe6-vmware-ibm development cluster](https://console-openshift-console.apps.qe6-vmware-ibm.dev09.red-chesterfield.com)

The test environment provides comprehensive semantic version testing capabilities with:
- Multiple managed clusters with diverse distribution versions (4.12.x through 4.15.x range)
- ACM 2.12.0 Console deployment with complete advanced search functionality enabled
- Semantic version comparison engine using semver v7.6.3 library integration
- Real cluster distribution version data accessible through managedclusters API
- Service account token authentication providing secure cluster data access for testing

**Infrastructure Readiness**: Environment supports comprehensive version comparison testing with live semantic version data and multi-constraint filtering validation across actual cluster deployments.

## 3. Implementation Analysis
**Primary Implementation**: [Distribution version comparison implementation - PR #3902](https://github.com/stolostron/console/pull/3902)

**Technical Implementation Details**:

**Semantic Version Engine Integration**:
- semver v7.6.3 library integration providing industry-standard semantic version comparison capabilities
- handleSemverOperatorComparison function implementing comprehensive operator logic with version coercion
- Intelligent partial version support enabling "4.13" to match "4.13.x" version ranges automatically
- Fallback mechanisms for non-semantic versions using standard string comparison methods

**Advanced Search Framework Enhancement**:
- Distribution version column integration with existing AcmSearchInput component architecture
- Complete SearchOperator enum expansion supporting all six comparison operators (=, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
- SearchableColumn interface enhancement enabling operator restrictions and column-specific validation
- Multi-constraint management with logical AND combination for complex filtering scenarios

**Console Integration Implementation**:
- ManagedClusters page enhancement with distribution version filtering capabilities
- getClusterDistributionString function extracting version information from multiple cluster sources
- Real-time filtering integration with existing table infrastructure and search highlighting
- HighlightSearchText component enhancement for version-based search result emphasis

**Related Implementation Work**:
- Foundation established in [ACM-13644 PR #3897](https://github.com/stolostron/console/pull/3897) - Core AcmSearchInput component
- Enhanced in [ACM-14557 PR #3913](https://github.com/stolostron/console/pull/3913) - Inferred range logic for partial version inputs

## 4. Test Scenarios Analysis
**Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive semantic version operator validation with multi-constraint filtering and range-based comparison across diverse cluster version scenarios

### Test Case 1: Basic Distribution Version Filtering with Comparison Operators
**Scenario**: Validate core semantic version comparison using greater than and less than operators for cluster filtering
**Purpose**: Ensure semantic version logic functions correctly with basic comparison operators and proper version parsing
**Critical Validation**: Version comparison operators work with semantic versioning standards and filter clusters appropriately
**Customer Value**: Enables administrators to quickly identify clusters above or below specific version thresholds for upgrade planning

### Test Case 2: Advanced Version Operators and Range-Based Filtering  
**Scenario**: Test comprehensive operator support including inclusive boundaries and exclusion filtering with partial version matching
**Purpose**: Validate all six operators function correctly with semantic version logic and intelligent range inference
**Critical Validation**: Inclusive/exclusive boundaries work correctly, partial versions expand to appropriate ranges, exclusion logic functions properly
**Customer Value**: Provides precise cluster filtering for complex version management scenarios including boundary conditions and version exclusions

### Test Case 3: Multiple AND Constraints for Distribution Version Filtering
**Scenario**: Verify multi-constraint functionality enabling complex version range filtering through logical AND combination
**Purpose**: Validate advanced search supports multiple simultaneous version constraints with proper logical combination
**Critical Validation**: Multiple constraints combine correctly with AND logic, constraint management (add/remove) functions properly, complex version ranges filter accurately
**Customer Value**: Enables sophisticated cluster management workflows requiring precise version range specifications for compliance and upgrade planning

**Comprehensive Coverage Rationale**: These scenarios validate the complete semantic version comparison capability spectrum from basic operator functionality to advanced multi-constraint filtering. Testing covers all six operators (=, !=, >, <, >=, <=), semantic version edge cases (partial versions, boundary conditions), and complex multi-constraint logic ensuring robust version-based cluster management across all enterprise deployment scenarios.
