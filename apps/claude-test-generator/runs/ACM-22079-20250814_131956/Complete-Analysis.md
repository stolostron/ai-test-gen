# ACM-22079 Complete Analysis

## üö® DEPLOYMENT STATUS

**VERDICT: ‚ùå NOT DEPLOYED**

**Evidence-Based Assessment:**
- **Code Implementation**: ‚úÖ PR #468 "ACM-22079 Initial non-recommended image digest feature" merged on July 16, 2025
- **Repository Status**: ‚úÖ Changes successfully integrated into main branch of stolostron/cluster-curator-controller
- **Technical Validation**: ‚úÖ Implementation adds GetImageDigestFromClusterVersion() function with three-tier search logic
- **Quality Assurance**: ‚úÖ Passed SonarQube gates with 81.2% coverage on new code
- **Release Status**: ‚ùå **CRITICAL ISSUE**: No releases since May 2022 (v2.0.0-MCE) - PR #468 not included in any released version
- **Test Environment**: ‚ùå qe6 cluster accessible but credentials expired, cannot validate runtime deployment
- **Integration Status**: ‚ùå Feature exists in source code but no evidence of deployment to test environments

**What Can Be Tested:**
- **Currently**: Nothing - Feature not deployed to accessible test environments
- **Post-Deployment**: Complete test suite ready for immediate execution once feature is released and deployed

**Deployment Gap Analysis:**
- PR merged July 16, 2025 but appears to be awaiting release packaging
- No version tags created since merge to indicate test environment deployment
- Gap between development complete and release deployment identified

## Implementation Status

**Primary Ticket**: ACM-22079 - Support digest-based upgrades via ClusterCurator for non-recommended upgrades
**Status**: Story in Review (Critical Priority)
**Implementation**: Complete via PR #468
**Business Driver**: Amadeus customer requirement for disconnected environment upgrades

**Key Technical Changes:**
- New `GetImageDigestFromClusterVersion()` helper function in pkg/jobs/utils/helpers.go
- Three-tier search priority: conditionalUpdates ‚Üí availableUpdates ‚Üí image tag fallback
- Modified hive.go integration for digest-based upgrade processing
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing tag-based workflows

**Related Tickets:**
- ACM-22080: QE task with initial test case (In Progress)
- ACM-22081: QE Automation task (New)
- ACM-22457: Documentation task (Backlog - waiting for 2.15 branch)

## Environment & Validation Status

**Environment**: qe6-vmware-ibm cluster (API accessible, credentials expired)
**Framework Version**: V2.0 - Intelligent Enhancement System
**Investigation Protocol**: Complete AI-powered 3-level deep analysis executed
**Validation Approach**: Evidence-based deployment assessment with release timeline analysis

**Quality Enhancement Applied:**
- AI Category Classification: Upgrade (95% confidence) with Resource Management secondary
- Category-Aware Template: Enhanced upgrade scenarios with critical system validation
- Quality Target: 95+ points for Upgrade category with critical priority
- Validation Focus: Version correlation, rollback procedures, disconnected environment support

**Critical Deployment Issues Identified:**
- **Release Gap**: Feature merged July 16, 2025 but no subsequent releases created
- **Test Environment Gap**: Cannot validate actual deployment without cluster access
- **Documentation Pending**: ACM-22457 waiting for 2.15 branch availability
- **Customer Impact**: Amadeus customer requirement blocked pending release deployment

## Feature Summary

**Core Functionality**: Enables ClusterCurator to use image digests instead of image tags for OpenShift cluster upgrades to non-recommended versions, specifically addressing disconnected environment requirements.

**Business Value**: Resolves critical customer (Amadeus) blocking issue where image tags don't work in disconnected environments, enabling essential cluster lifecycle management functionality.

**Technical Approach**: Three-tier search mechanism prioritizing image digests from conditionalUpdates list, with intelligent fallback to availableUpdates and finally image tags for backward compatibility.

**Customer Impact**: Direct resolution of Enterprise customer requirements for cluster lifecycle management in restricted/disconnected environments.
