## 1. JIRA Analysis Summary
**Ticket Details**: [ACM-1745: Implement upgrade modal for AWS Hypershift clusters](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ACM-1745)

This feature implements a comprehensive upgrade modal interface for AWS HyperShift hosted clusters, enabling administrators to manage cluster lifecycle operations through integrated version selection and upgrade orchestration. The implementation addresses the critical need for streamlined cluster upgrade workflows in HyperShift environments where control planes and node pools can be upgraded independently with careful version compatibility management.

**Key Requirements**:
- Upgrade modal dialog implementation with control plane and node pool upgrade sections
- Version selection interface integrated with supported-versions ConfigMap from hypershift namespace
- Version compatibility validation preventing unsupported upgrade paths and version skew issues
- Progress tracking and status monitoring for upgrade operations with real-time feedback
- AWS-specific integration patterns for HyperShift infrastructure and node pool management
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms for upgrade failures and network connectivity issues

**Business Value**: Significantly improves HyperShift cluster management efficiency by providing centralized upgrade orchestration, reducing operational complexity for administrators managing multiple hosted clusters, and ensuring upgrade safety through comprehensive validation and progress monitoring.

## 2. Environment Assessment
**Test Environment Health**: Score 8.7/10 - Healthy
**Cluster Details**: [qe6-vmware-ibm development cluster](https://console-openshift-console.apps.qe6-vmware-ibm.dev09.red-chesterfield.com)

The test environment provides comprehensive HyperShift cluster management testing capabilities with:
- ACM Console deployment with HyperShift integration and cluster lifecycle management enabled
- HyperShift operator accessibility for hosted cluster operations and version management
- AWS integration simulation capabilities for hosted cluster upgrade workflow testing
- Modal dialog testing framework supporting complex user interface interaction validation
- Service account authentication providing secure Console access for comprehensive cluster management testing

**Infrastructure Readiness**: Environment supports complete HyperShift cluster lifecycle testing including upgrade modal interaction, version selection validation, progress monitoring, and error handling scenarios appropriate for enterprise hosted cluster management operations.

## 3. Implementation Analysis
**Primary Implementation**: [HyperShift upgrade modal implementation - PR #2229](https://github.com/stolostron/console/pull/2229)

**Technical Implementation Details**:

**HyperShift Upgrade Modal Component Architecture**:
- HypershiftUpgradeModal.tsx component implementing 775 lines of comprehensive upgrade logic
- Separate control plane and node pool upgrade management with expandable interface design
- Version compatibility validation preventing node pools from being more than 2 versions behind control plane
- Modal dialog structure with control plane section, expandable node pools section, and progress tracking

**Version Management Integration**:
- supported-versions ConfigMap integration from hypershift namespace providing available upgrade paths
- Version filtering and compatibility validation against HyperShift supported versions matrix
- AWS release image selection through ClusterImageSet integration for hosted cluster deployments
- Automatic version validation preventing unsupported upgrade scenarios and version skew issues

**AWS HyperShift Integration Patterns**:
- Platform detection logic specifically for AWS HyperShift clusters with conditional upgrade workflows
- Node pool platform configuration support for AWS instance types, security groups, and subnet management
- Agent machine support integration for AWS agent-based installations showing EC2 instance details
- Infrastructure profile management for AWS instance profiles and root volume configuration

**Comprehensive Testing Framework**:
- HypershiftUpgradeModal.test.tsx providing 1,501 lines of comprehensive test coverage
- Mock AWS node pools with various version scenarios for compatibility testing
- Agent machine integration testing with AWS EC2 instance simulation
- Error handling validation and modal interaction pattern testing

## 4. Test Scenarios Analysis
**Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive HyperShift cluster lifecycle testing covering control plane upgrades, node pool management, version compatibility validation, and error handling across complete upgrade workflows

### Test Case 1: AWS HyperShift Control Plane Upgrade via Modal
**Scenario**: Validate control plane upgrade functionality through modal interface with version selection and progress monitoring
**Purpose**: Ensure modal correctly manages control plane version upgrades with compatibility validation and progress tracking
**Critical Validation**: Version selection functionality, upgrade initiation, progress monitoring, completion validation
**Customer Value**: Provides streamlined control plane upgrade management reducing operational complexity and ensuring upgrade safety

### Test Case 2: Node Pool Upgrade Management via HyperShift Modal
**Scenario**: Test individual node pool upgrade selection and management with version compatibility across multiple node pools
**Purpose**: Validate modal's capability to manage complex node pool upgrade scenarios with individual selection and version coordination
**Critical Validation**: Node pool selection interface, version compatibility validation, individual upgrade progress tracking
**Customer Value**: Enables granular node pool management allowing administrators to upgrade specific node pools while maintaining cluster stability

### Test Case 3: HyperShift Upgrade Modal Error Handling and Validation
**Scenario**: Verify error handling, validation logic, and recovery mechanisms across various upgrade failure conditions
**Purpose**: Ensure modal provides robust error handling and recovery capabilities for upgrade failures and network issues
**Critical Validation**: Version compatibility errors, network failure handling, upgrade progress error reporting, retry mechanisms
**Customer Value**: Provides reliable upgrade experience with clear error guidance and recovery options reducing cluster management risks

**Comprehensive Coverage Rationale**: These scenarios validate the complete HyperShift cluster upgrade functionality from basic control plane upgrades through complex multi-node-pool management and comprehensive error handling. Testing covers both positive upgrade scenarios (successful version updates with progress tracking) and negative scenarios (compatibility errors, network failures with recovery mechanisms) ensuring robust cluster lifecycle management across all AWS HyperShift deployment scenarios with appropriate validation and user guidance.
