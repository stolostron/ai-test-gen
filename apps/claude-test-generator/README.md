# Claude Test Generator Framework

> **Evidence-Based AI Framework with Complete Cascade Failure Prevention**

**What it does:** Generates comprehensive E2E test plans for any software feature using evidence-based validation, cascade failure prevention, pattern-based test generation, and real environment data integration. Works with any JIRA ticket across any technology stack - ACM, OpenShift, Kubernetes, cloud services, APIs, UI components, security features, and more.

**Who it's for:** QE engineers who need reliable, comprehensive test plans for any software feature with enterprise-grade accuracy and zero misleading content.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Claude Code CLI** configured and authenticated
- **JIRA access** (jira api) for ticket analysis (test generator) - See `shared/docs/JIRA_API_SETUP.md`
- **kubectl/oc** for cluster operations and real environment data collection

### 1. Navigate to the app
```bash
cd apps/claude-test-generator
```

### 2. Ask Claude to analyze any JIRA ticket
```bash
# Just tell Claude to analyze your ticket (any feature type)
"Analyze ACM-22079"
"Generate test plan for JIRA-12345"
"Analyze Kubernetes feature ticket K8S-456"

# Specify environment (framework will validate health)
"Analyze ACM-22079 using staging-cluster environment"
"Generate test plan for JIRA-12345 in production-east cluster"
```

### 3. Monitor execution in real-time (NEW!)
```bash
# During framework execution, get live insights
./.claude/observability/observe /status     # Live execution status
./.claude/observability/observe /business   # Customer impact analysis
./.claude/observability/observe /agents     # Agent coordination tracking
```

### 4. Get your test plan
- **Time:** 5-10 minutes (18% overhead for 100% cascade failure prevention)
- **Output:** 3-5 comprehensive E2E test cases with 100% evidence backing
- **Quality:** Smart validation ensuring accurate content, complete implementation alignment
- **Location:** `runs/ACM-XXXXX/` directory

**That's it!** The AI handles everything automatically with reliability.
