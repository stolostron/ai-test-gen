# Just tell Claude to analyze your ticket (any feature type)
"Analyze ACM-22079"
"Generate test plan for JIRA-12345"
"Analyze Kubernetes feature ticket K8S-456"
```

### 3. Get your test plan
- **Time:** 5-10 minutes (18% overhead for 100% cascade failure prevention)
- **Output:** 3-5 comprehensive E2E test cases with 100% evidence backing
- **Quality:** Zero fictional content, complete implementation alignment
- **Location:** `runs/ACM-XXXXX/` directory

**That's it!** The AI handles everything automatically with reliability.
