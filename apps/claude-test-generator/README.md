### Example Output Format

```markdown
### Test Case: Implement Custom Labels for ClusterCurator Job Pods

| Step | Expected Result |
|------|-----------------|
| 1. Create ClusterCurator with custom labels in annotations | ClusterCurator resource created successfully |
| 2. Verify Job pod inherits custom labels: `oc get pods -l job-name=clustercurator-job -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.labels}'` | Pod shows custom labels from ClusterCurator annotations |
| 3. Validate label propagation across multiple job executions | All subsequent Job pods inherit the same custom labels |
```
