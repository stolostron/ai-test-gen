- ✅ **Code Investigation**: Finds and analyzes related GitHub PRs
- ✅ **Deployment Check**: Determines if feature is actually deployed
- ✅ **Smart Scoping**: Tests only NEW functionality, skips existing features

### Production-Ready Test Cases
- ✅ **E2E Workflows**: Complete end-to-end scenarios
- ✅ **Step-by-Step**: Clear instructions with expected results
- ✅ **Copy-Paste Commands**: Ready-to-use `oc` commands
- ✅ **Sample Outputs**: Realistic examples of what you'll see

### Two File Output
```
runs/ACM-22079-V3.1-20250814_141514/
├── Test-Cases.md           # Clean test cases (ready to execute)
├── Complete-Analysis.md    # Full analysis + deployment status
└── metadata.json          # Quality scores and metrics
```

## 📋 Example Usage

### Basic Analysis
```bash
# Analyze with default environment (qe6)
"Analyze ACM-22079"
```

### Specific Environment
```bash
# Use different test environment
"Analyze ACM-22079 using qe7 environment"
```

### What Happens Automatically
1. **Connects** to test environment (qe6 by default)
2. **Investigates** JIRA ticket + all linked tickets + GitHub PRs
3. **Validates** if feature is deployed and working
4. **Generates** 3-5 comprehensive test scenarios
5. **Creates** ready-to-execute test cases
