## Real Data Integration

### Revolutionary Enhancement
The framework collects **actual environment data** during agent execution:

#### **Real Data in Expected Results**
```markdown
| Expected Result |
|-----------------|
| ClusterCurator created successfully:
```
clustercurator.cluster.open-cluster-management.io/test-curator created

Status conditions:
- type: "clustercurator-job"
  status: "True"
  reason: "JobCreated"
```
*[Real data collected by Agent E during feature detection]* |
```

#### **Universal Component Support**
- **ClusterCurator**: Real YAML outputs, controller logs, resource creation
- **Policy**: Real policy evaluation logs, governance controller outputs
- **Application**: Real ArgoCD sync logs, application health status
- **ANY Component**: Dynamic AI adaptation without configuration

#### **Data Priority System**
1. **Priority 1**: Agent D real infrastructure data (login, cluster operations)
2. **Priority 2**: Agent E real component data (YAML, logs, resource creation)
3. **Fallback**: AI Realistic Sample Generation (component-aware, contextual)

#### **Quality Enhancements**
