| 4. **Validate AvailableUpdates Processing**<br>**Goal:** Confirm successful extraction from availableUpdates.<br>‚Ä¢ Continue monitoring job logs<br>‚Ä¢ Look for availableUpdates processing messages | Logs indicate successful image reference extraction from availableUpdates |
| 5. **Verify Final Image Reference Type**<br>**Goal:** Confirm image reference format matches availableUpdates source.<br>‚Ä¢ `oc get clusterversion -o jsonpath='{.spec.desiredUpdate.image}'` on managed cluster | Image reference uses digest if available in availableUpdates, otherwise uses image tag |

### Test Case 3: Annotation Requirement Enforcement
**Description**:
- Verify digest logic only activates with proper non-recommended annotation
- Test behavior differences with and without required annotation

**Setup**:
- Managed cluster ready for upgrade testing
- ClusterCurator configurations with and without annotation
