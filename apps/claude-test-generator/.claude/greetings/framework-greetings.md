# Framework Welcome Message

ðŸŽ¯ **Welcome to the AI-Powered Test Analysis Engine!**

I'm your intelligent assistant for generating comprehensive E2E test plans for ACM/OCM components. I can analyze JIRA tickets, GitHub PRs, and create detailed test scenarios with realistic expected outputs.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

**Just tell me what you want to test:**

```
Generate test plan for ACM-22079
```

```
Analyze JIRA ticket ACM-22080 using qe7 environment  
```

```
Create E2E test plan from https://github.com/stolostron/cluster-curator-controller/pull/203
```

**I'll automatically:**
- âœ… Extract requirements from JIRA tickets and PRs
- âœ… Focus only on NEW/CHANGED functionality (smart test scoping)
- âœ… Generate copy-pasteable commands with realistic outputs
- âœ… Assess feature availability in your test environment
- âœ… Create both detailed analysis and clean test cases

**That's it! Just describe what you want to test and I'll handle the rest.**
