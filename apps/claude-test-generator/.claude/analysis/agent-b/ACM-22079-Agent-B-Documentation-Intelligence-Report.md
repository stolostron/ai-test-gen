## 1. ClusterCurator v1beta1 Architecture Analysis

### CRD Structure and Capabilities

**API Specification**:
- **API Version**: `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1`
- **Kind**: ClusterCurator
- **Scope**: Namespaced (proper isolation for multi-tenant environments)
- **Status**: Established and NamesAccepted in production environments

**Core CRD Fields Analysis**:
```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterCurator
metadata:
  name: <curator-name>
  namespace: <managed-cluster-namespace>
  annotations:
    cluster.open-cluster-management.io/upgrade-allow-not-recommended-versions: "true"  # NEW: Digest feature gate
spec:
  desiredCuration: upgrade|install  # Primary operation mode
  upgrade:
    desiredUpdate: "<target-version>"  # Version specification
    monitorTimeout: 120  # Upgrade timeout in minutes
    towerAuthSecret: ""  # Ansible Tower integration
    prehook: []  # Pre-upgrade automation
    posthook: []  # Post-upgrade validation
  install:  # Required by CRD schema
    towerAuthSecret: ""
    prehook: []
    posthook: []
  inventory: "<ansible-inventory>"  # Ansible integration point
```

**Critical Architecture Components**:
1. **Namespace Isolation**: Each ClusterCurator operates within managed cluster namespace
2. **Annotation-Gated Features**: Digest-based upgrades controlled via annotations
3. **Dual Operation Modes**: Support for both cluster installation and upgrade workflows
4. **Ansible Integration**: Built-in pre/post-hook automation capabilities
5. **Timeout Management**: Configurable upgrade operation timeouts

### Schema Validation and Required Fields

**Schema Intelligence**:
- **Mandatory Fields**: `desiredCuration`, `upgrade` section, `install` section (CRD requirement)
- **Optional Fields**: `towerAuthSecret`, `prehook`, `posthook`, `inventory`
- **Conditional Fields**: `desiredUpdate` required when `desiredCuration: upgrade`
- **Validation Rules**: Server-side validation ensures schema compliance

**Field Dependencies**:
```yaml
Schema Requirements:
  desiredCuration: upgrade → upgrade.desiredUpdate: required
  desiredCuration: install → install section: required
  Ansible Integration → towerAuthSecret: optional but recommended
  Pre/Post Hooks → prehook/posthook arrays: empty arrays acceptable
```

## 2. Digest-Based Upgrade Workflow Patterns

### Three-Tier Fallback Algorithm Business Logic

**Algorithm Architecture**:
The digest-based upgrade feature implements a sophisticated three-tier fallback mechanism to ensure upgrade reliability in various network conditions, particularly crucial for Amadeus disconnected environments.

**Tier 1: conditionalUpdates Discovery**
```yaml
Primary Path:
  - Query: ClusterVersion API conditionalUpdates field
  - Purpose: Discover digest information for non-recommended versions
  - Success Criteria: Digest found in conditionalUpdates array
  - Implementation: validateUpgradeVersion function enhancement (PR #468)
  - Trigger: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/upgrade-allow-not-recommended-versions: "true"
```

**Tier 2: availableUpdates Fallback**
```yaml
Secondary Path:
  - Trigger: conditionalUpdates discovery failure or empty response
  - Query: ClusterVersion API availableUpdates field
  - Purpose: Alternative digest discovery source for standard updates
  - Fallback Logic: Automatic progression when Tier 1 fails
  - Performance: Expected fallback time < 30 seconds
```

**Tier 3: Image Tag Final Fallback**
```yaml
Final Path:
  - Trigger: Both conditionalUpdates and availableUpdates failure
  - Method: Traditional image tag-based upgrade approach
  - Purpose: Ensure upgrade capability when digest discovery fails
  - Behavior: Maintains backward compatibility with existing workflows
  - Warning: Reduced reliability in disconnected environments
```

### Workflow State Machine

**Upgrade Lifecycle States**:
```yaml
State Progression:
  1. Initialization → ClusterCurator resource creation
  2. Digest Discovery → Three-tier algorithm execution
  3. Validation → Digest and version compatibility check
  4. Execution → ClusterVersion resource update
  5. Monitoring → Upgrade progress tracking
  6. Completion → Post-upgrade validation and status update

Error States:
  - DigestDiscoveryFailed → Fallback progression
  - ValidationFailed → Error status with user feedback
  - UpgradeFailed → Rollback or manual intervention required
  - TimeoutExceeded → Operation terminated with cleanup
```

### Business Rules and Validation Requirements

**Feature Gating Rules**:
1. **Annotation Requirement**: Digest-based logic only activated with specific annotation
2. **Version Compatibility**: Supports non-recommended versions when annotation present
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Standard upgrade behavior preserved without annotation
4. **Permission Requirements**: Proper RBAC for ClusterVersion API access

**Validation Logic**:
```yaml
Pre-Upgrade Validation:
  - Cluster health check (nodes Ready, operators Available)
  - Network connectivity assessment
  - Registry access validation
  - RBAC permission verification

During Upgrade:
  - Digest format validation (SHA256 hash)
  - Image availability confirmation
  - ClusterVersion API response validation
  - Resource utilization monitoring

Post-Upgrade Validation:
  - Cluster version confirmation
  - Component health verification
  - Performance baseline comparison
  - Rollback capability assessment
```
