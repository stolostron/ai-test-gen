# Feature Table Citation Requirements

## ðŸš¨ CITATION REQUIREMENTS FOR FEATURE TABLES

**SCOPE**: Complete reports only - feature analysis tables must include learning citations
**PURPOSE**: Help readers explore and learn more about specific ACM features
**FORMAT**: Add citations to feature descriptions, not test case summaries

## ðŸš« TEST SUMMARY TABLES - NO CITATIONS

### Clean Test Case Summary (NO CITATIONS)

| Test Case ID | Priority | Category | Expected Result |
|--------------|----------|----------|----------------|
| TC-001 | High | Cluster Management | Cluster created successfully |
| TC-002 | Medium | Policy Governance | Policy enforced correctly |
| TC-003 | High | Application Deployment | Application deployed via GitOps |
| TC-004 | Low | Observability | Metrics collected and displayed |

**IMPORTANT**: Test summary tables maintain clean format without citations for readability and execution clarity.

## ðŸ“‹ CITATION GUIDELINES FOR FEATURE TABLES

### When to Include Citations
- **Feature descriptions**: Help readers understand the feature's purpose and scope
- **Implementation status**: Provide evidence of current deployment state
- **Architecture explanations**: Link to source code and design documentation
- **API specifications**: Reference official API documentation
- **Component relationships**: Link to architectural documentation

### When NOT to Include Citations
- **Test execution steps**: Keep clean for test execution
- **Expected results**: Maintain clarity for validation
- **Priority assignments**: No citations needed for test categorization
- **Test case IDs**: Pure identifiers don't need citations

### Citation Placement Best Practices
1. **Feature Name**: Include JIRA ticket for feature development
2. **Description**: Add documentation links for learning
3. **Implementation**: Reference source code location
4. **Status**: Provide evidence of current state
5. **Learning Column**: Always include documentation links

This approach ensures feature tables serve as learning resources while keeping test execution tables clean and focused.
