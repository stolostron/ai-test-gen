### Conceptual Overview Pattern Examples
```python
# These are EXAMPLES of patterns the AI has learned, not fixed templates
CONCEPTUAL_OVERVIEW_PATTERNS = {
    # When dealing with access control patterns:
    "pattern_example_1": "implements [discovered functionality] for [identified use case], addressing [business need] with [technical approach]",
    
    # When dealing with UI/interface patterns:
    "pattern_example_2": "provides [user-facing capability] enabling [user goal] through [implementation approach]",
    
    # When dealing with integration patterns:
    "pattern_example_3": "enables [integration type] between [components] to achieve [business outcome]",
    
    # Generic pattern for new/unknown features:
    "adaptive_pattern": "delivers [feature purpose] by [technical solution] to support [business value]"
}

# The AI adapts these based on actual investigation findings
```

## INTEGRATION WITH PHASE 4 PROCESSING

### Template Application Sequence
```yaml
phase_4_complete_analysis_processing:
  1. "Apply executive summary template with environment-specific data"
  2. "Generate conceptual overview followed by technical details"
  3. "Populate JIRA intelligence with progress analysis"
  4. "Fill environment assessment with specific infrastructure details"
  5. "Structure testing strategy (E2E focus only)"
  6. "Generate success criteria (functional/integration/quality)"
  7. "Remove any performance/scale references"
  8. "Validate environment specificity compliance"
  9. "Ensure no placeholder usage"
  10. "Final quality gate validation"
```

### Environment Data Integration Points
```yaml
environment_data_sources:
  cluster_name: "Phase 1 environment assessment"
  acm_version: "Phase 1 version detection"
  console_url: "Phase 1 infrastructure analysis" 
  openshift_version: "Phase 1 cluster analysis OR explicit 'Not captured'"
  feature_deployment_status: "Phase 3 implementation analysis"
  deployment_readiness: "Phase 3 JIRA progress analysis"
```

**IMPLEMENTATION NOTE**: This template serves as the enforcement specification for complete analysis generation. All analysis reports MUST validate against these rules and include environment-specific details while maintaining the conceptual-to-technical flow structure.
