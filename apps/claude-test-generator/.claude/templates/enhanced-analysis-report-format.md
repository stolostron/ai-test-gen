# Enhanced Complete Analysis Report Format Requirements

## üö® MANDATORY CITATION ENFORCEMENT

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: All factual claims in complete reports MUST include verified citations using standardized formats:
- **JIRA**: [JIRA:ACM-XXXXX:status:last_updated]
- **GitHub**: [GitHub:org/repo#PR/issue:state:commit_sha]  
- **Documentation**: [Docs:URL#section:last_verified]
- **Code**: [Code:file_path:lines:commit_sha]

**SCOPE**: Complete reports only - test summary tables maintain clean format without citations

## üö® MANDATORY STRUCTURE ENFORCEMENT

All Complete-Analysis.md files MUST follow this exact 5-section structure. Reports deviating from this format will be REJECTED.

### Section 1: üö® DEPLOYMENT STATUS (FIRST SECTION - MANDATORY)

**Purpose**: Provide definitive deployment assessment with concrete evidence

**Required Elements**:
- **Environment Specification**: MUST clearly state which environment was used for validation [Env:cluster_url:connectivity:timestamp]
  - Examples: "qe6 cluster (OpenShift 4.16.37, ACM 2.13.2) [Env:https://api.qe6.example.com:200:2024-01-15T10:30:00Z]", "local test environment", "simulated AI analysis due to cluster unavailability"
- **Feature Status Assessment**: MUST provide one of four definitive statuses with citations:
  - ‚úÖ **FULLY OPERATIONAL**: Feature deployed and working with concrete validation data [JIRA:ACM-XXXXX:status:last_updated] [Docs:URL#section:last_verified]
  - üîÑ **PARTIALLY OPERATIONAL**: Specific components working/missing with detailed breakdown [Code:file_path:lines:commit_sha]  
  - ‚ùå **NOT DEPLOYED**: Feature unavailable with concrete evidence and timeline [GitHub:org/repo#PR:state:commit_sha]
  - üêõ **IMPLEMENTATION BUG**: Feature deployed but malfunctioning with error analysis [JIRA:ticket_id:status:last_updated]
- **Supporting Evidence**: MUST provide concrete data collected during validation with citations:
  - Version checks and correlation results [Env:cluster_url:connectivity:timestamp]
  - Behavioral testing outcomes [Code:test_file_path:lines:commit_sha]
  - Schema validation results [Docs:URL#schema-section:last_verified]
  - Error logs or success confirmations [Code:log_file_path:lines:commit_sha]
- **Version Correlation**: MUST correlate ACM/MCE versions with feature availability and deployment timeline [JIRA:ACM-XXXXX:status:last_updated] [Docs:URL#version-matrix:last_verified]

**Format Example**:
```markdown
## üö® DEPLOYMENT STATUS

**Environment**: qe6 cluster (OpenShift 4.16.37, ACM 2.13.2) [Env:https://api.qe6.example.com:200:2024-01-15T10:30:00Z]
**Status**: ‚ùå NOT DEPLOYED [JIRA:ACM-22079:Open:2024-01-15]
**Evidence**: Feature API endpoint not accessible, version mismatch detected [Code:pkg/api/routes.go:45-52:a1b2c3d4]
**Version Correlation**: Target version 2.14 not yet available in cluster running 2.13.2 [Docs:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/acm#version-matrix:2024-01-15]
```

### Section 2: Implementation Status (SECOND SECTION - MANDATORY)

**Purpose**: Detailed investigation of actual implementation work and PRs

**Required Elements**:
- **PR Investigation Results**: MANDATORY detailed analysis including:
  - **When PRs Found**: 
    - PR status (open/closed/merged)

    - Review and approval timeline
    - Link to actual PR
  - **When No PRs Found**: 
    - Explicitly state "No related PRs found after comprehensive search"
    - List search criteria and repositories checked
    - Explanation of why PRs might not be found (feature not yet implemented, different naming, etc.)
- **Code Change Analysis**: When PRs are found, provide:
  - Specific code modifications
  - New functions or classes added
  - Modified configuration files
  - Integration points changed
- **Implementation Timeline**: 
  - Development start/completion dates
  - Target release cycle information
  - Current development phase

**Format Example**:
```markdown
## Implementation Status

**PR Investigation Results**: 
- **PR Found**: stolostron/cluster-curator-controller#123 (Merged: 2025-07-15, Author: developer-name)
- **Code Changes**: [Detailed analysis of actual code]
- **Implementation Timeline**: [Development timeline with dates]

OR

**PR Investigation Results**:
- **No related PRs found** after comprehensive search of stolostron repositories
