# Enhanced Complete Analysis Report Format Requirements

## üö® MANDATORY STRUCTURE ENFORCEMENT

All Complete-Analysis.md files MUST follow this exact 5-section structure. Reports deviating from this format will be REJECTED.

### Section 1: üö® DEPLOYMENT STATUS (FIRST SECTION - MANDATORY)

**Purpose**: Provide definitive deployment assessment with concrete evidence

**Required Elements**:
- **Environment Specification**: MUST clearly state which environment was used for validation
  - Examples: "qe6 cluster (OpenShift 4.16.37, ACM 2.13.2)", "local test environment", "simulated AI analysis due to cluster unavailability"
- **Feature Status Assessment**: MUST provide one of four definitive statuses:
  - ‚úÖ **FULLY OPERATIONAL**: Feature deployed and working with concrete validation data
  - üîÑ **PARTIALLY OPERATIONAL**: Specific components working/missing with detailed breakdown  
  - ‚ùå **NOT DEPLOYED**: Feature unavailable with concrete evidence and timeline
  - üêõ **IMPLEMENTATION BUG**: Feature deployed but malfunctioning with error analysis
- **Supporting Evidence**: MUST provide concrete data collected during validation:
  - Version checks and correlation results
  - Behavioral testing outcomes
  - Schema validation results
  - Error logs or success confirmations
- **Version Correlation**: MUST correlate ACM/MCE versions with feature availability and deployment timeline

**Format Example**:
```markdown
## üö® DEPLOYMENT STATUS

**Environment**: qe6 cluster (OpenShift 4.16.37, ACM 2.13.2)
**Status**: ‚ùå NOT DEPLOYED
**Evidence**: [Concrete evidence from validation]
**Version Correlation**: [ACM/MCE version analysis]
```

### Section 2: Implementation Status (SECOND SECTION - MANDATORY)

**Purpose**: Detailed investigation of actual implementation work and PRs

**Required Elements**:
- **PR Investigation Results**: MANDATORY detailed analysis including:
  - **When PRs Found**: 
    - PR status (open/closed/merged)
    - Creation and merge dates
    - Author and repository information
    - Review and approval timeline
    - Link to actual PR
  - **When No PRs Found**: 
    - Explicitly state "No related PRs found after comprehensive search"
    - List search criteria and repositories checked
    - Explanation of why PRs might not be found (feature not yet implemented, different naming, etc.)
- **Code Change Analysis**: When PRs are found, provide:
  - Specific code modifications
  - New functions or classes added
  - Modified configuration files
  - Integration points changed
- **Implementation Timeline**: 
  - Development start/completion dates
  - Target release cycle information
  - Current development phase

**Format Example**:
```markdown
## Implementation Status

**PR Investigation Results**: 
- **PR Found**: stolostron/cluster-curator-controller#123 (Merged: 2025-07-15, Author: developer-name)
- **Code Changes**: [Detailed analysis of actual code]
- **Implementation Timeline**: [Development timeline with dates]

OR

**PR Investigation Results**:
- **No related PRs found** after comprehensive search of stolostron repositories
- **Search Criteria**: "ACM-22079", "digest upgrade", "non-recommended", "ClusterCurator"
- **Explanation**: Feature appears to be in early planning phase, implementation PRs not yet created
```

### Section 3: Feature Details (THIRD SECTION - MANDATORY)

**Purpose**: Technical deep-dive into the feature using actual implementation details

**Required Elements**:
- **Technical Implementation**: Detailed explanation using actual code from PRs (when available)
- **Code Analysis**: Specific code changes, functions, logic modifications
- **Integration Points**: How feature integrates with existing systems
- **Architecture Impact**: Structural changes and system modifications  
- **Configuration Requirements**: New annotations, parameters, setup requirements

**Format Example**:
```markdown
## Feature Details

**Technical Implementation**: 
[Detailed explanation with actual code snippets from PRs]

**Code Analysis**:
[Specific analysis of implementation details]

**Integration Points**:
[How feature connects with existing components]

**Configuration Requirements**:
[New settings, annotations, or parameters needed]
```

### Section 4: Business Impact (FOURTH SECTION - MANDATORY)

**Purpose**: Business justification and customer value analysis

**Required Elements**:
- **Customer Value**: Clear business benefits and justification
- **Use Cases**: Primary and secondary scenarios where feature adds value
- **Problem Resolution**: Specific customer problems this feature solves
- **Market Impact**: Competitive advantages and strategic positioning

**Format Example**:
```markdown
## Business Impact

**Customer Value**: 
[Clear business benefits]

**Use Cases**:
- Primary: [Main use case scenario]
- Secondary: [Additional scenarios]

**Problem Resolution**:
[Customer problems solved]

**Market Impact**:
[Competitive and strategic benefits]
```

### Section 5: Relevant Links (FINAL SECTION - MANDATORY)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive reference collection for future investigation
