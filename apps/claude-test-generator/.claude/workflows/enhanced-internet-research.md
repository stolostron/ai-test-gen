# Internet Research Protocol

## üåê Comprehensive Internet Research Strategy

### Phase 1: Targeted Technology Research
**Goal:** Deep understanding of implementation technology and patterns

#### Core Technology Research
1. **Base Technology Understanding**
   - Research main technology (e.g., "ClusterCurator OpenShift")
   - Understand architecture and design patterns
   - Learn operational characteristics and limitations

2. **Feature-Specific Research**
   - Search for specific feature implementation (e.g., "OpenShift digest upgrades")
   - Research best practices and common patterns
   - Understand security and operational implications

3. **Domain Knowledge Research**
   - Industry standards and common practices
   - Related technologies and integration patterns
   - Performance and scalability considerations

### Phase 2: Implementation-Specific Research
**Goal:** Understand how the specific feature should work

#### Feature Behavior Research
1. **Expected Behavior Patterns**
   - How the feature should behave in normal conditions
   - Edge cases and error handling
   - Integration with other components

2. **Configuration and Usage**
   - Required configuration parameters
   - Optional settings and their impacts
   - Common usage patterns and examples

3. **Validation and Testing**
   - How to validate feature functionality
   - Common testing approaches
   - Monitoring and observability practices

#### Research Validation Checklist
- [ ] Technology architecture understood
- [ ] Feature purpose and scope clear
- [ ] Implementation patterns identified
- [ ] Configuration requirements known
- [ ] Testing approaches validated
- [ ] Common issues and solutions identified

### Phase 3: Cross-Reference and Validation
**Goal:** Ensure research accuracy and completeness

#### Multi-Source Validation
1. **Official Documentation**
   - Vendor documentation (Red Hat, IBM, etc.)
   - Product documentation and guides
   - API documentation and specifications

2. **Community Sources**
   - GitHub repositories and examples
   - Community forums and discussions
   - Blog posts and technical articles

3. **Academic and Industry Sources**
   - Technical papers and whitepapers
   - Industry best practices and standards
   - Security and compliance guidelines

### Phase 4: Knowledge Synthesis
**Goal:** Create comprehensive understanding for accurate test generation

#### Integration Analysis
1. **Component Interactions**
   - How feature integrates with existing systems
   - Dependencies and prerequisites
   - Impact on other components

2. **Operational Considerations**
   - Deployment requirements
   - Monitoring and maintenance needs
   - Performance and scalability impacts

3. **Risk Assessment**
   - Potential failure modes
   - Security considerations
   - Business impact analysis
