# Missing Data Intelligence & Linked Ticket Investigation

## üîç Comprehensive Ticket Analysis Protocol

The framework performs **thorough investigation** of all related tickets:

### Multi-Level Ticket Investigation
1. **Main Ticket Analysis**: Requirements, acceptance criteria, technical specifications
2. **All Subtasks Investigation**: Implementation status, PR links, completion state
3. **Dependency Chain Analysis**: Blocking/blocked tickets, prerequisites
4. **Epic Context Review**: Parent epics, strategic objectives, architectural decisions
5. **Related Ticket Mining**: Historical context, previous implementations, lessons learned
6. **Nested Link Traversal**: Following all linked tickets to full depth for complete context

### PR and Implementation Deep Dive
- **Code Change Analysis**: Actual implementation details from attached PRs
- **Deployment Status Assessment**: Whether changes are live in test environments
- **Feature Availability Determination**: What can be tested now vs. future testing
- **Integration Point Identification**: How components connect and interact

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Intelligent Feature Availability Analysis (MANDATORY)

**Framework ALWAYS proceeds with full test generation capabilities regardless of version compatibility. The AI performs intelligent analysis to:**

#### Phase 1: Version Intelligence Gathering
1. **Extract Fix Version from JIRA**: Identify target ACM/product version for the feature
2. **Determine Environment Version**: Get actual version running on test environment
3. **Collect Implementation Evidence**: Gather PR merge status, code availability, deployment timeline

#### Phase 2: Feature Availability Validation During Testing
**During environment validation, perform actual feature testing:**
```bash
# Get ACM version from environment
oc get multiclusterhub -A -o jsonpath='{.items[*].status.currentVersion}'

# Test actual feature availability (component-specific validation)
# Example: Check if ClusterCurator has new digest functionality
oc get crd clustercurators.cluster.open-cluster-management.io -o yaml | grep -i digest || echo "No digest functionality found"
```

#### Phase 3: Intelligent Analysis & Diagnosis
**AI determines root cause with supporting evidence:**

**Scenario A: Feature Not Yet Deployed (Expected)**
- Version mismatch detected (e.g., feature targets 2.15, environment runs 2.14)
- PR merged but not in environment build
- Expected behavior - no bug suspected

**Scenario B: Feature Should Be Available But Failing (Potential Bug)**
- Version compatibility suggests feature should work
- PR merged and environment version should include feature
- Component validation fails despite expected availability
- Potential deployment issue or feature regression

#### Phase 4: Comprehensive Reporting
**Analysis Report MUST include:**
- **Feature Deployment Status**: Clear assessment with supporting evidence
- **Version Analysis**: Target vs Environment with compatibility reasoning
- **Validation Results**: Actual test environment findings with commands executed
- **Root Cause Assessment**: Whether missing feature is expected (version) or indicates potential bug
- **Testing Readiness**: Current capability vs future testing roadmap

**Framework generates complete test plans regardless of current availability, ensuring maximum value when feature becomes available.**

### Missing Data Detection & Response
When critical data is missing, the framework:
- **üö® Identifies Gaps**: Missing PRs, inaccessible designs, undefined architectures
- **üìä Quantifies Impact**: What specific testing cannot be performed
- **‚úÖ Scopes Available Work**: Focus on testable components
- **üìã Provides Future Roadmap**: Test cases ready for when missing data becomes available

## üéØ Investigation Quality Standards

- **100% Ticket Coverage**: Every linked ticket analyzed regardless of nesting level
- **PR Verification**: All attached PRs examined for implementation details
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Ensuring consistency across related tickets
- **Context Preservation**: Understanding full feature history and evolution
