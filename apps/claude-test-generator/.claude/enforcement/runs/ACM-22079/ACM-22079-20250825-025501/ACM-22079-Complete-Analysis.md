## Documentation Intelligence Analysis (Agent B)

### ClusterCurator Functionality
- **Core Purpose:** Managed cluster upgrade orchestration
- **Digest-Based Upgrades:** Image digest validation for reliability
- **Upgrade Workflow:** Automated upgrade execution with monitoring
- **Integration Points:** ManagedClusterView for status reporting

### 3-Tier Fallback Algorithm
1. **Primary Path (conditionalUpdates):** 
   - Preferred upgrade method using conditional update logic
   - Validates upgrade prerequisites and dependencies
   - Provides highest reliability for standard scenarios

2. **Secondary Path (availableUpdates):**
   - Fallback when conditionalUpdates fails
   - Uses available update channels for upgrade path
   - Maintains upgrade capability with reduced validation

3. **Tertiary Path (image tag):**
   - Final fallback using direct image tag references
   - Emergency upgrade path for critical scenarios
   - Ensures upgrade completion regardless of metadata availability

### Disconnected Environment Considerations
- **Local Registry Requirements:** Mirrored image access mandatory
- **Network Isolation:** No external registry dependencies
- **Image Mirroring:** Pre-staged upgrade images required
- **Configuration Validation:** Registry source configuration critical
