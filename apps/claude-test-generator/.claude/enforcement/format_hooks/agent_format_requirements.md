# FORMAT ENFORCEMENT FOR AGENT A OUTPUT

When providing intelligence for test case generation, ensure your output enables creation of test cases that meet these requirements:

1. **Login Step Specification:** Ensure test cases start with exact format: "**Step 1: Log into the ACM hub cluster**"
2. **Clear Command Examples:** Provide specific CLI commands that can be formatted as single-line table entries
3. **Expected Output Examples:** Include realistic command outputs for validation steps
4. **Environment Context:** Provide environment-specific details for placeholder replacement

Your intelligence should support test cases with:
- Single-line table format compatibility
- Realistic sample outputs
- Clear step-by-step progression
- Security-compliant placeholder usage
