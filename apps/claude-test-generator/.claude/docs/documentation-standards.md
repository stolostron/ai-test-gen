# Documentation Standards

## Writing Principles

### Language Guidelines
- **First-Time Reader Focus**: Write as if the reader has no prior knowledge of the system
- **Clear, Direct Language**: Use simple, unambiguous terminology
- **Avoid Marketing Terms**: Never use "Enhanced", "Advanced", "Revolutionary", "Cutting-edge", "Next-generation", "Innovative", "State-of-the-art", "Premium", "Elite", "Ultimate", "Superior"
- **No Version Assumptions**: Never reference "before" and "after" versions or improvements
- **Professional Tone**: Maintain technical accuracy without promotional language

### Prohibited Patterns
- ❌ "Enhanced Framework Overview" → ✅ "Framework Overview"
- ❌ "Revolutionary Evidence-Based AI Framework" → ✅ "Evidence-Based AI Framework"
- ❌ "Before Enhancement (ACM-22079 Failure)" → ✅ "Problem Analysis" or "System Requirements"
- ❌ "After Enhancement (Complete Prevention)" → ✅ "Current Implementation"
- ❌ "Advanced Deep Reasoning Service" → ✅ "Deep Reasoning Service"

### Structure Guidelines
- Start with clear purpose statements
- Use descriptive, functional headings
- Present information logically without implying previous versions
- Focus on what the system does, not how it's better than something else

### Examples of Correct Language
- "The framework provides evidence-based validation"
- "This service prevents cascade failures"
- "The system analyzes implementation details"
- "Framework coordinates multiple agents"

### Examples to Avoid
- "The enhanced framework now provides..."
- "This revolutionary service..."
- "Our advanced system..."
- "The upgraded framework..."

## Implementation
These standards apply to ALL documentation in the test-generator application and should be enforced during any documentation updates or creation.
