# QE Intelligence Service Testing Strategy
## Reality-Based QE Analysis Validation

### Testing Overview
**OBJECTIVE**: Validate that the QE Intelligence Service successfully provides reality-based QE automation analysis by analyzing actual test files, aligning with Implementation Reality findings, and preventing assumption-based coverage assessments that contributed to the original ACM-22079 failure.

### Implementation Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Testing**: Test individual QE analysis components and evidence verification
2. **Integration Testing**: Test service integration with Implementation Reality and Pattern Extension services
3. **Scenario Testing**: Test against ACM-22079 and other known QE analysis scenarios
4. **Repository Testing**: Test repository focus enforcement and exclusion compliance
5. **Evidence Testing**: Test actual test file analysis and coverage mapping
6. **Regression Testing**: Ensure no degradation of existing QE analysis functionality

This testing strategy ensures the QE Intelligence Service successfully provides reality-based QE automation analysis that prevents the assumption-based coverage assessments that contributed to the original ACM-22079 failure, while maintaining high-quality QE analysis aligned with actual implementation capabilities and repository focus requirements.
