# Pattern Extension Service Testing Strategy
## ACM-22079 Scenario Validation

### Testing Overview
**OBJECTIVE**: Validate that the Pattern Extension Service successfully prevents the original ACM-22079 cascade failure by generating tests exclusively from proven patterns in automation_upgrade.spec.js, blocking fictional UI generation, and ensuring all test elements are traceable to existing successful code.

### Original Failure Analysis
```yaml
original_acm_22079_failure:
  root_cause: "Assumption-based test generation without pattern validation"
  failure_points:
    1. fictional_ui_workflows: "Generated UI test cases without UI pattern evidence"
    2. invalid_yaml_fields: "Used spec.upgrade.imageDigest field not found in schemas"
    3. contradictory_agents: "Feature Detection said 'NOT available' but tests were generated"
    4. assumption_based_generation: "Created workflows not proven in existing tests"
  
  cascade_impact: "Misleading test plan delivered to ACM operators"
  quality_impact: "95% confidence in 'NOT available' feature ignored"
```

### Pattern Extension Service Expected Prevention
```yaml
pattern_extension_prevention_strategy:
  blocking_mechanisms:
    1. ui_pattern_validation:
       - action: "Search for UI upgrade patterns in existing test files"
       - expected_finding: "NO UI upgrade functionality in automation_upgrade.spec.js"
       - blocking_decision: "BLOCK UI test generation due to lack of pattern evidence"
    
    2. yaml_field_validation:
       - action: "Validate spec.upgrade.imageDigest against existing successful tests"
       - expected_finding: "Field NOT found in automation_upgrade.spec.js or other successful tests"
       - blocking_decision: "REJECT usage of unverified YAML field"
    
    3. pattern_source_requirement:
       - action: "Require every test element to have existing pattern source"
       - expected_finding: "Only CLI patterns available in automation_upgrade.spec.js"
       - generation_decision: "Generate CLI-based tests extending proven patterns"
    
    4. implementation_reality_coordination:
       - action: "Coordinate with Implementation Reality Agent findings"
       - expected_alignment: "Align with 'NOT available' feature status"
       - output_decision: "Generate version-aware test strategy, not feature tests"

### Implementation Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Testing**: Test individual pattern validation components
2. **Integration Testing**: Test service integration with existing framework
3. **Scenario Testing**: Test against ACM-22079 and other known scenarios
4. **Regression Testing**: Ensure no degradation of existing functionality
5. **Performance Testing**: Validate acceptable performance impact
6. **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive quality metrics validation

This testing strategy ensures the Pattern Extension Service successfully replaces assumption-based test generation with a proven pattern-based approach, preventing the cascade failures that occurred in the original ACM-22079 scenario while maintaining high-quality outputs aligned with actual implementation capabilities.
