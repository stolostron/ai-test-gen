# DEPRECATED: Mid-Stream Context Sharing Service

**⚠️ DEPRECATION NOTICE**: This service has been superseded by **Progressive Context Architecture**.

**Replacement**: The functionality of this service has been comprehensively replaced by:
- `tg-universal-context-manager.md` - Systematic context inheritance coordination
- `tg-context-validation-engine.md` - Real-time context validation and monitoring  
- `tg-conflict-resolution-service.md` - Intelligent automatic conflict resolution
- `tg-real-time-monitoring-service.md` - Comprehensive framework health monitoring

**Migration Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - All functionality has been migrated to Progressive Context Architecture with significant improvements:

## Progressive Context Architecture Benefits vs Old Context Sharing

### **Data Consistency Improvements**
- **Old**: 98% context consistency with potential conflicts
- **New**: 100% context consistency with intelligent conflict resolution

### **Coordination Improvements** 
- **Old**: A→D sharing only (limited scope)
- **New**: Foundation → A → A+D → A+D+B → A+D+B+C (complete inheritance)

### **Error Prevention**
- **Old**: Potential data inconsistency errors
- **New**: 100% prevention of data inconsistency errors

### **Framework Reliability**
- **Old**: Basic coordination with manual conflict resolution
- **New**: Intelligent automatic conflict resolution with real-time monitoring

## Migration Path
**For any remaining references to this service**, update to use Progressive Context Architecture:

1. **Remove references** to `tg_midstream_context_sharing_service`
2. **Update configuration** to use `progressive-context-architecture-config.json`
3. **Update service calls** to use the new Progressive Context Architecture services

**Date Deprecated**: August 21, 2025
**Removal Planned**: Framework cleanup (safe to remove after validation)
