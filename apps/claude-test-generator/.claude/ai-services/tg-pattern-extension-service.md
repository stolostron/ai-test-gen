# AI Pattern Extension Service (TEST GENERATION REPLACEMENT)

## Service Transformation Overview
**COMPLETE TEST GENERATION REPLACEMENT**: Evidence-based pattern extension service that replaces assumption-driven test generation with proven pattern replication. Generates tests only by extending existing successful patterns from user's codebase.

## Mission Statement
**EXTEND, NEVER INVENT** - Generate test cases only by extending proven successful patterns from actual test implementations, preventing fictional test creation and ensuring all outputs are grounded in working code.

## Core Pattern Extension Capabilities

### 1. Pattern Discovery Engine
- **Successful Test Analysis**: Extract patterns from proven successful test files (*.spec.js, *.test.*, *.cy.js)
- **Pattern Library Creation**: Build library of verified successful test patterns from user's codebase
- **Implementation Validation**: Verify patterns represent actual working test implementations
- **Pattern Classification**: Classify patterns by type (UI, CLI, API, mixed) and complexity

### 2. Evidence-Based Extension Framework
- **Pattern Source Requirement**: All test generation must trace to existing successful pattern
- **Extension Methodology**: Extend proven patterns with validated modifications
- **Reality Alignment**: Ensure extended patterns align with Implementation Reality findings
- **Quality Validation**: Validate extended patterns maintain original pattern success factors

### 3. Pattern-Based Test Generation
- **Template Extraction**: Extract test structure templates from successful implementations
- **Validated Extension**: Extend templates with validated parameters and configurations
- **Evidence Traceability**: Maintain traceability from generated tests to source patterns
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure extended tests maintain quality of source patterns
