# AI Evidence Validation Engine (FICTION PREVENTION)

## Critical Service Overview
**MANDATORY FICTION PREVENTION**: Continuous evidence monitoring engine that ensures all agent content has implementation traceability and prevents fictional content generation. Operates as framework-wide quality gate with authority to halt fictional content creation.

## Mission Statement
**PREVENT FICTIONAL CONTENT** - Detect and block agents from generating content without implementation evidence, ensuring all test generation is based on actual codebase reality.

## Core Evidence Validation Capabilities

### 1. Fictional Content Detection
- **Implementation Traceability**: Ensure all generated content traceable to actual code/documentation
- **YAML Field Validation**: Verify all YAML fields exist in actual schemas  
- **Workflow Evidence**: Confirm all workflows backed by actual implementation
- **Pattern Verification**: Validate content against proven successful patterns

### 2. Evidence-Based Monitoring
- **Real-Time Detection**: Monitor agent content during generation (not after)
- **Evidence Database**: Maintain traceability records for all approved content
- **Pattern Library**: Track proven successful patterns from actual implementations
- **Quality Threshold**: Enforce minimum evidence requirements for content approval

### 3. Smart Intervention System
- **Targeted Halting**: Stop specific agent when fictional content detected
- **Evidence Requirement**: Force agents to provide implementation evidence
- **Smart Threshold**: Intervene on significant issues, allow minor inconsistencies
- **Recovery Mechanism**: Allow agents to continue with proper evidence

## Implementation Validation

### Testing Against Known Failure Patterns
```yaml
validation_test_scenarios:
  fictional_yaml_test:
    scenario: "Agent attempts to use non-existent YAML fields"
    expected_behavior: "Engine blocks field usage until schema evidence provided"
    validation_criteria: "No fictional YAML fields in generated content"
  
  unsupported_workflow_test:
    scenario: "Agent creates workflows without implementation backing"
    expected_behavior: "Engine halts workflow generation until evidence provided"
    validation_criteria: "All workflows traceable to actual implementation"
  
  assumption_content_test:
    scenario: "Agent generates content based on assumptions"
    expected_behavior: "Engine blocks content and requires evidence"
    validation_criteria: "All content backed by concrete evidence"
  
  pattern_violation_test:
    scenario: "Agent creates content without pattern compliance"
    expected_behavior: "Engine enforces Pattern Extension Service usage"
    validation_criteria: "All content extends proven successful patterns"
```

### Performance Considerations
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Evidence validation during generation to prevent waste
- **Smart Intervention**: Target significant issues, allow minor inconsistencies
- **Pattern Caching**: Maintain library of proven patterns for fast validation
- **Evidence Database**: Quick lookup of validated evidence to avoid re-verification

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Evidence-Based Authority
- **Content Blocking Power**: Authority to prevent fictional content generation
- **Evidence Requirements**: Mandatory evidence backing for all generated content
- **Pattern Enforcement**: Require compliance with proven successful patterns

### 2. Implementation-First Validation
- **Reality Grounding**: All validation based on actual implementation evidence
- **Schema Verification**: Direct validation against actual schema definitions  
- **Code Backing**: Preference for code evidence over documentation claims

### 3. Quality Maintenance
- **Evidence Standards**: Maintain high standards for evidence quality
- **Pattern Library**: Continuous improvement of proven successful patterns
- **Framework Integrity**: Ensure framework state remains evidence-based

This Evidence Validation Engine serves as the **critical fiction prevention system** for the entire framework, ensuring quality, accuracy, and reliability by blocking fictional content generation and requiring implementation evidence for all generated content.
