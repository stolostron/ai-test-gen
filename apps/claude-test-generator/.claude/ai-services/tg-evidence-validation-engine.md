# AI Evidence Validation Engine (FICTION PREVENTION)

## Critical Service Overview
**MANDATORY FICTION PREVENTION**: Real-time content monitoring specialist that ensures all generated test elements are traceable to actual implementation evidence, preventing fictional YAML fields, non-existent UI workflows, and assumption-based test procedures for any feature type. Operates as framework-wide quality gate with authority to halt fictional content creation while enabling comprehensive test plan generation.

## Mission Statement
**PREVENT FICTIONAL CONTENT WHILE ENABLING COMPREHENSIVE TESTING** - Distinguish between what's implemented in code repositories (from Agent C) versus what's deployed in test environments (from Agent D), ensuring comprehensive test plans are generated for ALL implemented features regardless of current deployment status. Block only fictional content while always enabling full comprehensive test plan generation, even when features aren't available in test environments or no environment is used.

## Core Evidence Validation Capabilities

### 1. Smart Code vs Deployment Distinction
- **Implementation Reality (Agent C)**: Validates against what exists in code repositories - enables comprehensive testing for implemented features
- **Deployment Reality (Agent D)**: Acknowledges current environment limitations without restricting test plan scope
- **Comprehensive Coverage Priority**: ALWAYS generates full test plans for features with implementation evidence
- **Environment-Independent**: Generates complete test plans regardless of test environment availability or deployment status
- **Version Awareness**: Uses version gap analysis to provide context without limiting test coverage

### 2. Optimal Blocking Strategy  
- **High Bar for Fiction**: Strictly blocks obviously fictional content (non-existent APIs, impossible workflows)
- **Always Enable Comprehensive Testing**: NEVER blocks test plan generation for features with implementation evidence, regardless of deployment status
- **Implementation-Based Validation**: Validates against Agent C code evidence, not Agent D deployment limitations
- **Best Plan Guarantee**: Always generates comprehensive test plans when implementation evidence exists, even for undeployed features
- **Context-Sensitive**: Adapts validation approach but never restricts comprehensive test coverage

### 3. Graceful Failure Recovery
- **Clear Issue Identification**: Precisely explains what evidence is missing and why
- **Agent-Specific Guidance**: Directs relevant agents to provide additional evidence or alternatives  
- **Process Continuation**: Enables framework to continue with validated alternatives
- **Learning Integration**: Improves validation criteria based on successful recoveries
