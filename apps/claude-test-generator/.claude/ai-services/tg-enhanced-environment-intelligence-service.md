## üìä **AI Intelligence vs Script Pattern Comparison**

### Traditional Script Approach (Eliminated)
```python
# OLD: Script-based pattern matching
def extract_with_hardcoded_patterns():
    error_patterns = [r".*ERROR.*", r".*WARN.*", r".*Failed.*"]  # Hardcoded
    yaml_sections = ["metadata.annotations", "spec.upgrade"]     # Hardcoded
    component_types = {"clustercurator": "upgrade", "policy": "governance"}  # Hardcoded
```

### AI Intelligence Approach (Implemented)
```python
# NEW: Pure AI reasoning and understanding
def extract_with_ai_intelligence(component_context, test_scenario):
    # AI understands what log messages matter for this specific component and scenario
    relevant_logs = ai_analyze_log_semantic_relevance(component_context, test_scenario)
    
    # AI determines what YAML sections help testers validate this specific test
    relevant_yaml = ai_determine_yaml_validation_importance(component_context, test_scenario)
    
    # AI analyzes any component without predefined knowledge
    component_understanding = ai_analyze_component_behavior_dynamically(component_context)
    
    return AI_DrivenIntelligence(relevant_logs, relevant_yaml, component_understanding)
```
