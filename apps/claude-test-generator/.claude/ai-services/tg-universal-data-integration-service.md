## ü§ñ **AI Service Architecture**

### Universal Component Intelligence Engine

**Dynamic Analysis Layer**: AI analyzes any feature context to understand what components, resources, and patterns are involved without relying on predefined lists or hardcoded component knowledge.

**Intelligent Sampling Layer**: AI determines what real environment data would be most valuable for testers and collects it intelligently.

**Relevance Optimization Layer**: AI extracts the most relevant portions of collected data to enhance Expected Results without overwhelming testers.

**Fallback Generation Layer**: AI generates realistic samples when real data is unavailable, using Kubernetes patterns and component behavior understanding.

### AI Universal Data Collection Process

**Phase 1: Component Discovery** (AI Analysis)
- AI analyzes JIRA ticket content and GitHub implementation to understand what components are involved
- Identifies relevant Kubernetes resources, operators, controllers without hardcoded mappings
- Determines data collection strategy based on component types and feature scope
- Plans optimal sampling approach for maximum tester value

**Phase 2: Intelligent Environment Sampling** (AI Collection)
- AI connects to test environment and intelligently samples relevant data
- Collects actual resource YAML, controller logs, status progressions based on component analysis
- Captures realistic error scenarios and timing patterns
- Validates data quality and relevance for test case enhancement

**Phase 3: Smart Data Integration** (AI Processing)
- AI analyzes collected data to extract most relevant portions for Expected Results
- Optimizes extracted samples for tester comprehension and validation confidence
- Generates enhanced Expected Results with realistic examples
- Creates fallback samples when real data unavailable using AI reasoning

**Phase 4: Quality Enhancement** (AI Validation)
- AI validates enhanced Expected Results for accuracy and helpfulness
- Ensures optimal balance between comprehensiveness and conciseness
- Verifies tester confidence and validation guidance quality
- Integrates feedback for continuous improvement
