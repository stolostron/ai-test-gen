## üìÑ CLAUDE.md FILES UPDATED

### 1. Root Level CLAUDE.md Files

#### `/ai/ai_systems/CLAUDE.md` (Root Configuration)
**Status**: ‚úÖ UPDATED  
**Changes Made**:
- Updated subtitle from "complete isolation architecture" to "hierarchical isolation architecture"
- Added comprehensive description of hierarchical access control
- Included strict app containment and real-time violation detection
- Added scalable multi-app architecture foundation

**New Description**:
```
AI Systems Suite delivering modular, isolated applications with comprehensive Smart Proxy Router 
for seamless root access while maintaining strict app containment. Features hierarchical access 
control where root level maintains full orchestration capabilities while apps are completely 
isolated within their boundaries, ensuring scalable multi-app architecture with real-time 
violation detection and zero external access capability.
```

- Included real-time violation detection with `.claude/isolation/` system
- Added external access prevention details for both apps
- Added comprehensive "Hierarchical Isolation Architecture" section
- Updated technical implementation to reflect hierarchical access control

**New Isolation Section Added**:
```
## üîí Hierarchical Isolation Architecture

Root Level Access: Complete orchestration and cross-app capabilities from AI Systems base directory

External Access Prevention: Apps cannot access ../../, ../other-app/, or system directories  
Internal Operations Preserved: Full functionality maintained within app boundaries  
Scalable Foundation: Multi-app architecture ready for unlimited additions
```
