## 🎯 CORRECTED ISOLATION MODEL IMPLEMENTED

### Required Access Pattern (ACHIEVED)
```
Root Level (/Users/ashafi/Documents/work/ai/ai_systems/)
├── CLAUDE.md (Root) → CAN access ALL apps ✅
├── apps/
│   ├── claude-test-generator/ 
│   │   ├── [App A files] → CANNOT access outside app directory ✅
│   │   └── CLAUDE.md (App A) → ONLY access within app A ✅
│   └── z-stream-analysis/
│       ├── [App B files] → CANNOT access outside app directory ✅
│       └── CLAUDE.md (App B) → ONLY access within app B ✅
└── tests/ → CAN read apps for monitoring ✅
```

### Access Control Matrix (IMPLEMENTED)
