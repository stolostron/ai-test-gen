# CLAUDE.md Update Summary - Hierarchical Isolation Integration

## ‚úÖ UPDATE STATUS: COMPLETE

**Date**: 2025-08-24  
**Scope**: Integration of strict app isolation and hierarchical access control  
**Files Updated**: 3 core documentation files  

## üìÑ FILES UPDATED

### 1. CLAUDE.md (Main Application Configuration)
**File**: `/apps/claude-test-generator/CLAUDE.md`  
**Changes Made**:
- ‚úÖ Updated main description to include "Hierarchical Isolation"
- ‚úÖ Added "Strict App Isolation" capability
- ‚úÖ Mentioned hierarchical root access preservation

**New Description**:
```
Test Analysis Engine with Intelligent Validation Architecture and Hierarchical Isolation
delivering evidence-based test plan generation... and Strict App Isolation ensuring 
complete containment within app boundaries while preserving hierarchical root access 
for orchestration.
```

### 2. CLAUDE.core.md (Core Application Identity)
**File**: `/apps/claude-test-generator/CLAUDE.core.md`  
**Changes Made**:
- ‚úÖ Enhanced ISOLATION ENFORCEMENT section with strict boundaries
- ‚úÖ Added hierarchical access control information  
- ‚úÖ Included real-time monitoring reference
- ‚úÖ Added strict app isolation to core principles

**New Isolation Enforcement**:
```
## ISOLATION ENFORCEMENT
- This configuration ONLY applies in: apps/claude-test-generator/
- NEVER reference files outside this directory
- NEVER reference other applications  
- NEVER load external configurations
- STRICT APP BOUNDARIES: Complete containment within app directory enforced by isolation engine
- HIERARCHICAL ACCESS: Root level maintains orchestration capabilities, apps completely isolated
- REAL-TIME MONITORING: Violation detection and prevention active at .claude/isolation/
```

**New Core Principle Added**:
```
- Strict App Isolation: Complete app containment within directory boundaries with 
  real-time violation detection, hierarchical access preservation for root orchestration, 
  and zero external access capability ensuring scalable multi-app architecture security
```

### 3. README.md (User-Facing Documentation)
**File**: `/apps/claude-test-generator/README.md`  
**Changes Made**:
- ‚úÖ Updated header to include "Hierarchical Isolation"
- ‚úÖ Added "Strict App Isolation" to description
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive "Strict App Isolation with Hierarchical Access" section

**New Header**:
```
Evidence-Based AI Framework with Intelligent Validation Architecture, 
Hierarchical Isolation, and Complete Cascade Failure Prevention
```

**New Feature Section Added**:
```
### Strict App Isolation with Hierarchical Access
- Complete App Containment: Apps cannot access files outside their directory boundaries
- Hierarchical Control: Root level maintains full orchestration and cross-app capabilities
- Real-Time Monitoring: Violation detection and prevention with .claude/isolation/ system
- External Access Blocked: Prevents ../../, ../other-app/, and system directory access
- Internal Operations Preserved: Full functionality within app boundaries maintained
- Scalable Architecture: Multi-app isolation foundation for unlimited app additions
```
